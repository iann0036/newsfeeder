Once you have uploaded the changes, you need to go to <b>Theme Settings</b> and <b>RE-SAVE YOUR SETTINGS</b>. This will ensure the new features are used correctly. Do note that this will not change any of your previous settings. Those will be saved from your previous setup.</p>

<h3 id="downloaded">A. Downloaded Files</h3>

	<ul>
	
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Includes all the help files, credits and video tutorial resources.</li>
<li><strong>PSD Files</strong>: All the necessary PSD files associated to the King Size template.</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="uploading">B. Uploading King Size</h3>
<p>To upload the template to your WordPress website, you'll need either to access your server space via FTP or Web Manager and install the "kingsize" template to the following path (we're using <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>):</p>
<p><strong>WordPress Directory:</strong> > <strong>wp-contents</strong> > <strong>themes</strong> > <strong>[upload the KingSize zipped folder here]</strong></p>
<p>Once you've uploaded the zipped folder, you'll be required to unpack the folder and the contents within in so WordPress can interact with those files stored inside the folder.</p>
<div class="goodnews">
<p class="goodnewssign">Good news</p>
<p>Note: It is not required to be uploaded as a zip, but does speed up the process while uploading since its compressed and in a smaller format. Unpacking the template automatically creates the folder "kingsize" with all the corresponding files necessary.</p></div>



<h3>C. Installing & Activating King Size</h3>
<p>Once uploaded to <strong>wp-contents</strong> > <strong>themes</strong> > <strong>[kingsize folder here]</strong> you will need to log into your WordPress dashboard, locate the "Appearance" from the left-hand sidebar and click the "Themes" option. Here you'll be able to activate the newly installed template, KingSize.</p>
<p>If you do not see the template available via <strong>Appearance</strong> > <strong>Themes</strong>, than you may wish to recheck the upload you've completed and make sure you've unzipped the folder KingSize.</p>

<h3 id="exp_install">D. Express Install & Setup</h3>

<div class="video">
<object classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000' codebase='http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'><param name='movie' value='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' /><param name='flashvars' value='i=180346' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><embed src='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' flashvars='i=180346' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'></embed></object></div>

<p>The express install can be found inside the "Documentation" folder you've downloaded from Theme Forest. This express setup is in the format of an ".xml" file, locate the file:</p>
<p>Import File: <strong>express-setup.xml</strong> [located in the "<strong>Documentation</strong>" folder]</p>
<p>With this file, you can create an express setup which will give you an end result that looks exactly like the demo you've seen prior to purchasing the template. This xml file will allow you to re-create exactly what it is we've already created on the demo and gives you a head start on getting your website setup and ready to use so you can edit and manage it.</p>
<p>If you've never imported an .xml install, you can follow these quick simple steps:
	
	<ol>
	
<li>Log into your WordPress Dashboard using your username and password.</li>
<li>In the left-hand sidebar, locate "<strong>Tools</strong>" and click the option to "<strong>Import</strong>" into WordPress.</li>
<li>Next you'll need to select the type of Import you'll be doing, we want WordPress.</li>
<li>You'll then be asked to install the Importer, click "<strong>Install Now</strong>" on the right hand side.</li>
<li>Now you'll want to "<strong>Activate, Install and Run the Importer</strong>" you've just installed.</li>
<li>Now you'll want to select "Choose a file" and locate the .xml file we've included.</li>
<li>It'll ask you to select a user to assign these posts, pages, etc. to, select your account.</li>
<li>It may take a few minutes to install depending on your connection and web server.</li>
<li>Once the import has completed, you should now have all the included setup done.</li>

	</ol>
	
<div class="goodnews">
<p class="goodnewssign">Good news</p>
<p>Note: Once you've installed your XML Express Setup, you want to go to <strong>Appearance</strong> > <strong>Menus</strong> and assign the new <strong>Main Menu</strong> to the Header Menu option for these items to display in the navigation.  Also note that in order to include the "Menu Subtitles" / "Descriptions" beneath each menu item, you have to click the <strong>Screen Options</strong> tab at the top and checkmark the option for <strong>Descriptions</strong>.</p></div>

<p>At this point, your website should now take the form you've seen available in our demo. </p>


<h2 id="options">3. ADMIN THEME OPTIONS</h2>

<div class="video">
<object classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000' codebase='http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'><param name='movie' value='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' /><param name='flashvars' value='i=180366' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><embed src='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' flashvars='i=180366' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'></embed></object></div>

You can easily drag and drop those images in the order you want at which point once dropped into place they are automatically saved in that order. You can re-order these images at anytime you wish, simply by repeating these steps.</p>

Each option has beside it a helpful tooltip when mousing over the questionmark icon.</p>

<h3>D. Disabling the Slider:</h3>
<p>To disable the slider just go into the General Theme Settings and uncheck the enabled slider box. You will want to make sure that the "Global Background Preferences" has an image uploaded and saved as this will become your static single background image on the homepage. With no image assigned here as your background, the homepage will by default show a black and unoccupted background.</p>

<p>To include a featured image in your blog article, use the "<strong>Featured Image</strong>" to assign one when creating your new post.  This will automatically be displayed within the blog archives.</p>
<h3>C. Add Custom Background</h3>
<p>Inside your "<strong>Add New / Edit Posts</strong>" area, you will see beneath the contents area, a place known as the "<strong>write-panel</strong>". This area includes the ability for you to upload a new background image you want associated with that specific post. This will then override the default background image you previously setup in the Theme Options.</p>
<p>If you do not want to upload an image but rather enter a URL to a background image of your choice, just enter the URL to that image in the text area and it'll appear when saved.</p>

<h2 id="gallery">8. CREATING A NEW GALLERY</h2>

<div class="video"><object classid='clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000' codebase='http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'><param name='movie' value='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' /><param name='flashvars' value='i=180377' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><embed src='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' flashvars='i=180377' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'></embed></object></div>

<p>Included are 5 different Gallery Templates and with 3 of those galleries includes 4 style options that can be assigned to the individual gallery when used. These do require being created in "Pages" and is not available through the use of "Posts", only pages.</p>
<h3>A. Gallery Types</h3>
<p>There are 5 galleries types included. These are (preview the live demo):</p>

<ul>
<li>Colorbox: <a href="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/colorbox/2-columns">http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/colorbox/2-columns</a></li>
<li>FancyBox: <a href="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/fancybox/2-columns">http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/fancybox/2-columns</a></li>
<li>prettyPhoto: <a href="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/prettyphoto/2-columns">http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/prettyphoto/2-columns</a></li>
<li>slideViewer: <a href="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/slideviewer">http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/slideviewer</a></li>
<li>Galleria: <a href="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/galleria">http://www.kingsizetheme.com/portfolio/galleria</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To select a gallery, you need to create a "<strong>New Page</strong>" and inside this New Page, you'll see the option to assign a "<strong>Template</strong>" specific to this page. This is located to the right, is directly beneath the "<strong>Publish / Update</strong>" button in the area titled "<strong>Page Attributes</strong>".</p>
<p>Now using this drop-down menu, you will see a variety of options here to be used with your new Page being created. Select the desired gallery type from the available selections here.</p>
<h3>B. Selecting a Layout Style</h3>
<p>Included with 3 of these gallery types, is 4 different layout styles to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Column Layout</strong> (available with ColorBox, FancyBox and prettyPhoto - <a href="http://kingsizetheme.com">see demo site</a>)</li>
<li><strong>3 Column Layout</strong> (available with ColorBox, FancyBox and prettyPhoto - <a href="http://kingsizetheme.com">see demo site</a>)</li>
<li><strong>4 Column Layout</strong> (available with ColorBox, FancyBox and prettyPhoto - <a href="http://kingsizetheme.com">see demo site</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Grid Layout</strong> (available with ColorBox, FancyBox and prettyPhoto - <a href="http://kingsizetheme.com">see demo site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting these layout styles will ONLY apply to your galleries when you've selected the Page Template it corresponds with. So even though you may have selected [i.e.,] 2 columns, if no portfolio type is selected it will not work.</p>
<h3>C. Uploading your Images</h3>
<p>We've decided to make use of the native WordPress Media Gallery for displaying your photos and images. It involves less work, less steps and faster end results...</p>
<p>To add your images, you just need to locate the "<strong>Upload / Insert</strong>" area at the top of your "<strong>Add New Page</strong>", and just beneath the "<strong>Title</strong>" area of that page. You'll see beside this upload area, 4 small icons that when clicked will open a new window in lightbox.</p>
<p>Click the first icon (looks like a picture frame) and this will allow you to attach / upload new media (image) files directly from your computer. You can also select more than just one image at a time by dragging your mouse and selecting multiple images at once.</p>
<p>Once you have uploaded your images click "<strong>Save</strong>", and then exit out of the lightbox window. *<b>DO NOT INSERT THESE IMAGES INTO YOUR POST AFTER UPLOADING</b>* otherwise you will notice you have two types of galleries displaying in the Gallery Page you've just created. Remove the inserted gallery if you've done this.</p>
<p>Now that you've uploaded those images, just close out of that lightbox window. Remember, do not insert those images. The way we have designed this template is it will automatically take those images you've uploaded and display them in the page you've created. If your seeing two types of images on your page, one looks like our demo while the other does not, this means you have inserted the gallery. Go to your post, in the "Content Editor" remove that inserted gallery / image and publish / update.</p>
<p>We've also created a video tutorial for uploading and attaching images to help as a visual aid.</p>
<h3>D. Managing your Images</h3>
<p>You can manage your images through the "Media Gallery". Just return to the page you've created for your gallery and click the picture frame icon beside "Upload / Insert" and this will load the lightbox window once more. Inside here, you will see an area at the top titled "<strong>Gallery</strong>" and should display a number beside it representing the number of images you've attached.</p>
<p>Click this Gallery tab and you'll be shown all the images related to this specific page.</p>
<p>Once you see the images, you can drag and drop those images in the specific order you'd like them to appear in the frontend of your website. You can also click the "<strong>show</strong>" link to edit the titles, descriptions and details pertaining to those specific images in that gallery.</p>
<p>Watch the video tutorial for a visual explanation of managing and editing your photos.</p>
<h3>E. Add Custom Background</h3>
<p>Just as you did with the posts inside your blog, you can create and assign a specific background image on all pages created. Either select the option to "<strong>upload</strong>" an image or enter the URL to the image you wish to use as your background for this specific page.
Inserting a background image using the "<strong>write-panel</strong>" will allow you to override the default background you set up previously in the Theme Options. These changes will only affect the specific pages you assign those custom backgrounds to and nowhere else.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">9. CREATING A NEW PORTFOLIO</h2>
<p>Inside your WordPress Dashboard, in the left-hand sidebar you will see the "<strong>Portfolio</strong>" menu option. Click this and you will have the option to view all "<strong>Portfolio</strong>" items, "<strong>Add New</strong>" portfolio items, and create "<strong>Portfolio Categories</strong>" that you can use to organize the different type of portfolios you wish to display on your site. This also enables you the ability to create multiple portfolios and assigning categories.</p>
<h3>A. Adding a Portfolio Item</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click "<strong>Add New</strong>" and this will open the post-type for the portfolio item.</li><br />
<li>Type in the title of your portfolio item where it says "<i>Enter title here</i>".</li><br />
<li>Add in your actual portfolio page contents specific to that portfolio item.
<br />- This information will be displayed when the "<strong>read more</strong>" is clicked on.
<br />- The attached portfolio item will be displayed beneath these items contents.</li><br />
<li>Beneath here you will find the corresponding "<strong>write-panel</strong>" options for your item.</li><br />
<li>The first option is to "<strong>Upload an Image</strong>", this is if you want a single portfolio image.
<br />- Click "<strong>browse</strong>", upload your image and click "<strong>insert</strong>" or copy and paste URL.
<br />- You can also insert a URL to the image you want used as this portfolio item.</li><br />
<li><strong>VIDEO PORTFOLIO ITEMS</strong> are found beneath the single image upload.
<br />- You’ll need to include the "<strong>Image Thumbnail</strong>", click <i>browse > upload > insert image</i>.
<br />- Paste the URL of your YouTube or Vimeo videos in the next write-panel option.
<br />- You can also insert the "<strong>Embedded Code</strong>" for your videos to be displayed in the portfolio.
<br />- Now include the "<strong>Video Height</strong>" if necessary. The <i>default height is 300 pixels</i> for this.</li><br />
<li><strong>The Portfolio EXCERPT</strong> is what is shown on the portfolio page when being viewed.
<br />- If no excerpt, it will automatically grab the first paragraph and display it accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. It’s pretty simple. Now click the "<strong>Publish</strong>" or "<strong>Update</strong>" button to complete your changes.</p>

<h3>B. Creating a Portfolio Page</h3>

<p>So now you've successfully added a Portfolio item(s), you'll want to learn how to display those items. To do this, you need to create a new page using the page template "Portfolio". Once you create a Portfolio Page, you just simply assign which category for your Portfolios you want displayed and the rest is done automatically. See the below steps for instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to "<strong>Pages</strong>" in your sidebar and click "<strong>Add New</strong>".</li><br />

<li>Title the portfolio page accordingly, ie., "<i>Music Videos</i>" or "<i>Photography</i>".
<br />- You can create multiple portfolios by creating new pages.</li><br />

<li>In the right sidebar of this page, look for "<strong>Page Attributes</strong>" and select from the dropdown "<strong>Portfolio</strong>". This will assign that page the Portfolio template you’ll be using.</li><br />

<li>Scroll down till you see the "<strong>write-panel</strong>" and you’ll need to setup a few options:
<br />A. <strong>Select a Portfolio Category</strong>: This uses the Categories you created for your Portfolio.
<br />- If you created a category called "<i>Photography</i>" and you want this specific page to display all your photography images, than you would select that associated category to be used.
<br />B. <strong>Portfolio Page Layouts</strong>: Although looks best with TWO and THREE column layouts, we have also made available the other layouts which are also used by the galleries for your interest.</li><br />

<li>Lastly, you still have the option to assign a custom background image for this specific page.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want text to show above your portfolios, when creating this page, just add the text to the contents box / editor and that text will display above the portfolios as shown in the demonstration.</p>

<p>Once you have created this page, you’ll want to link it to your menu / navigation. To do this, go to "<strong>Appearance</strong>" > "<strong>Menus</strong>" and add the new page you just created to your navigation. Add a brief description if desired, click save and once done you should be able to see the new item in your menu.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Permalinks:</strong>

<p>
Often asked is "how do I make pretty links" which is also referred to as "Permalinks". To do this, it's important you start your site with permalink structure prior to making posts and pages.  Otherwise, it's going to be a difficult task having to re-create those link permalink structures.</p>

<p>
Log into your dashboard, go to "Settings", find "Permalinks" and edit the structure to look like:</p>
<p>
/%category%/%postname%/</p>
<p>
If this is not the structure you want, you can learn more about Permalinks visiting WordPress:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks</a></p>

</li>
<li><strong>Featured Images:</strong> 

<p>
King Size does support the use of Featured Images in your Blog postings.  Referring to the demo, you can see in the blog archive there is a featured image being displayed.  To do this you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click "<strong>Featured Image</strong>" link in the right sidebar when creating a new post.</li>
  <li>A lightbox window will appear where you can upload / attach your image.</li>
  <li>Select the desired image for your Featured Image and click "<strong>Upload</strong>".</li>
  <li>Once the image has uploaded, it'll expand the image details / properties to set.</li>
  <li>At the bottom, there is the option to make this image your "<strong>Featured Image</strong>".</li>
  <li>Click "Save" after completing your post and the image will be carried into the frontend.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>	How to use "Custom Menus" in WordPress 3.0 + </strong>
<p>Here's the official documentation: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel">http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel</a> </p> </li>


<li><strong>Unlimited use of "Custom Backgrounds" for Pages and Posts:</strong> 

<p>
Kingsize makes available a write-panel option in both "pages" and "posts" that allows you the ability to override the default global background previously set via Theme Options.  This means that on any individual page and/or post, you can have a unique background specific to its use.</p>
<p>
To include a background, scroll down beneath the contents of your post and you'll see an area titled "<strong>Override the default Background</strong>" with the option to either<strong> "enter a URL</strong>" or to "<strong>Upload a background directly from your computer</strong>".</p>
<p>
Once you've inserted your URL for the background image, or uploaded an image from your computer, complete the remainder of your entry and once ready, click "Publish / Update".  At this point, the background once saved will automatically override the global background assigned earlier through the Theme Options panel.</p></li>


<li><strong>How to Install WordPress Themes:</strong> 
<p>
For complete documentation, view the official guide provided on behalf of WordPress, by visiting:<br /> <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes">http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes</a><br />and follow the documentation here.</p></li> 

<li><strong>How to use Lightbox in WordPress Media Galleries</strong>
<p>When inserting your gallery, there is an option that asks "<strong>Link Thumbnails To</strong>", you'll want to change this from "<i>Attachment Page</i>" to use "<strong>Image File</strong>" instead. This will allow for the lightbox effect to work. Otherwise, images will load in a new page.</p>
<p>When inserting single images, just insert the image into your post and make sure its linked to the image. This will automatically apply the lightbox effect to those images inserted into your post.</p></li>

<li><strong>Broken Template and/or Missing Style Sheet Error Message</strong>
<p>One of the more common issues being reported. This is due to a mistake you've made, not at fault of our template. You are trying to upload the ENTIRE zipped folder you downloaded from Theme Forest. This is NOT correct. You need to open that folder you've downloaded and inside you will see another folder titled "<strong>Template v3</strong>", it is this folder you will find INSIDE the actual template. Either upload as a zip and extract on your server, or extract on your desktop and upload as a whole to the /themes/ directory.</p></li>

</ul>

This is a very handy program when viewing documents / files to compare changes between the two files. It also makes carrying those changes over very simple, highlighting what is new and giving the option to carry those new changes over. Recommended to ease updating your changes.
<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: After updating your version of KingSize, be sure to go to General / Theme Settings and <b>RE-SAVE</b> the settings so any new changes can take place. This will not cause any loss of the old saved settings, rather just applying those which are new.</p>
