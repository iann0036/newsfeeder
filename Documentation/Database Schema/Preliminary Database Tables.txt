DATABASE TABLE DRAFT

user 1--* sheet 1--* feed 1--* article
where:


USER
----
username		varchar		PK
password		text		NOT NULL
avatar			mediumblob
dateRegistered	timestamp	NOT NULL
name			text		NOT NULL
email			text		NOT NULL	UNIQUE
(settings for page layouts)
	layout		integer
	...
	...
verified		text		(will be an idenfifier as to whether the user has email verified, null or 1 for verified, random string representing validation ticket string for not verified)


SHEET
-----
sheetID			integer		PK
title			text
user			varchar		FK referencing USER.username
alternatively could be
-----
title			text		PK
user			varchar		PK, FK

(settings for feed displaying)
	...
(optional) lastUpdated	date	NOT NULL


The lastUpdated field can be in both SHEET and FEED, will have advantages and disadvantages:
- if in SHEET as well will make processing quicker (removing a select from PHP) but will duplicate the data
- if only in FEED will save data, but will need the extra select
I'd say it would be preferrable to add to the SHEET, since this means it can be automatically updated whenever a feed is read, instead of needing to select on runtime


FEED
----
feedID			integer		PK
sheetID			integer		FK
title			varchar		NOT NULL
url				text		NOT NULL	UNIQUE
priority/craw-wait (this will be an identifier for when the feed should be crawled again)
lastUpdated		date		NOT NULL


ARTICLE
-------
articleID		integer		PK
feedID			integer		FK
title			text		NOT NULL
body			text		NOT NULL
dateAdded		timestamp (if going off when crawled) OR date (if going off the data in RSS)
