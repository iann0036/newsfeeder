Mitt Romney had criticized his administration for being too tough against China, and bringing a protectionist case at the World Trade Organization.</p>\n<p><strong>The statement:</strong> Obama cited a case in which the Chinese \"were flooding us\" with cheap tires. \"And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Gov. Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist,\" Obama said.</p>\n<p><strong>The facts:</strong> In 2009, the Obama administration sought tariffs against China for dumping tires into the United States. The World Trade Organization upheld the tariffs.</p>\n<p>On its website, Romney's campaign cites where the Republican candidate addressed the case in his 2010 book \"No Apology.\"</p>\n<p>\"President Obama's action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for their support of his campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers,\" Romney said. \"Protectionism stifles productivity.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The result was indeed inherently protectionist, according to Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>\n<p>\"It means it will raise prices for American consumers on tires, both domestic and imported,\" Paal said.</p>\n<p>But the case was a minor one in the overall scheme of things, he added. Both sides have engaged in such symbolic activity, \"but neither is willing to take action that would seriously affect economic relations between our two economies,\" he added.</p>\n<p>The subject of China has been raised over and over again during the campaign, with each candidate accusing the Chinese of stealing American jobs through unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p>In broad terms, both men offered similar views, even using some of the same language:</p>\n<p>\"China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules,\" Obama said. \"So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.\"</p>\n<p>\"They're making some progress; they need to make more,\" said Romney, who vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day as president. \"They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world that's stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.\"</p>\n<p>First, has China really stolen U.S. jobs? The numbers say yes. Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the U.S. trade deficit with China \"eliminated or displaced more than 2.7 million U.S. jobs,\" according to a report published in August by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.</p>\n<p>The primary category from which jobs have been lost has been in the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p>The candidates have complained because, while the United States allows the free market, in large part, to dictate how much a dollar is worth and how much people will be paid in the United States, China uses its power to keep wages low.</p>\n<p>So, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the average employer has to pay about $35 per hour in salary and benefits to hire a worker on a production line, a Chinese factory pays only about $1.36 per hour for the same work.</p>\n<p>In response, many companies have moved jobs to China to take advantage of the lower wages. Consequently, Chinese products tend to be cheaper to buy all over the world.</p>\n<p>The result has been that Chinese exports to the United States have soared in recent years, while U.S. exports to China have lagged far behind.</p>\n<p>What can a U.S. president do about that?</p>\n<p>Probably not much. If the United States were to raise trade barriers, China could do the same. If the United States were to forbid U.S.-based companies from shipping jobs to China, that might leave U.S. companies less competitive in the world market.</p>\n<p>And if China were to say it is no longer interested in buying U.S. debt, that could make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow the money it needs to operate.</p>\n<p><strong>The conclusion:</strong> In the tire case above, Obama is correct in his characterization of Romney's position. In the larger case of what to do about U.S.-China relations,<strong> </strong>both candidates have promised to get tough. But that will hardly be the last word.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/23/politics/fact-check-china-tires/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a

His book, an expose of the infiltration of the police department by adherents of a particular brand of Islam, was banned and police raided newspaper offices to collect copies of it.</p>\n<p>Sik was released last March after being detained for more than a year, but the court case against him is ongoing and the journalists he was arrested alongside of are still in jail.</p>\n<p>In a phone interview with CNN on Monday, Sik said his arrest was meant \"to send the message: If we can arrest even these people, then we can definitely come after you.\"</p>\n<p>Erdogan defended his record in a CNN interview broadcast last month.

The bomb that missed Laith killed at least seven people .</p>\n<p>At 6:30 a.m. the following morning, I'm met more with confusion than humor when I ask the same thing of a group of day laborers in the rundown neighborhood of Bataween. \"We only watch football,\" says one man. \"We don't care about elections.\"</p>\n<p>In fact, only one of the workers in the group of 40 or so standing around even knows that there's an election going on in the United States.</p>\n<p>Rayad Salam, a 25-year-old from Nasiriya, catches my attention. Like everyone else on the corner, he is wearing a generic threadbare soccer tracksuit, the ubiquitous uniform of the terminally poor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2012/09/12/opinion/athens-postcard/index.html\">Postcard: Athenians fear what follows U.S. election</a></p>\n<p>Rayad came to Baghdad after graduating from university with a degree in Classical Arabic. He wanted to be a teacher, but couldn't find a job back home so came to the capital to work. Rayad makes 25,000 IQD day ($20) if he manages to find work, which he only does about three days a week. He tells me he'll take any kind of work, including the most dangerous job in Iraq: policeman.</p>\n<p>When I ask him why, his answer is so universal it could have come from any one of the millions of Americans still suffering from the financial crisis: \"All I want is a job so I can take care of my family.\"</p>\n<p>He leans forward to tell me something else, but a middle aged man pushes his way through the crowd and tells me I'd better leave. The group standing around me is drawing attention to itself and we're now making a perfect target for a bomb attack.</p>\n<p>Traffic squeezes its way around Baghdad's clogged streets, which are pinched every few miles by military checkpoints where bored soldiers lazily hold metal rods — nicknamed \"Solomon's cane\" — next to passing cars, in the hope they will \"sniff\" out hidden bombs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2012/07/10/opinion/havana-postcard/index.html\">Postcard: Should U.S. raise fist to Cuba?</a></p>\n<p>The cars gridlocked in traffic make it clear that although Baghdad is still dangerous, it certainly isn't poor. Among the old and beat up vehicles are plenty of brand new Land Cruisers, Pajeros, BMW X series, and black Hummer H3s. These are not the armored versions that move in convoys from fortified location to fortified location -- they are the personal cars of the city's middle class.</p>\n<p>In the evenings the city's wealthy roam the streets of Karada, in the center of the city, where the lights shine almost as bright as Times Square. Here you can indulge in handmade ice cream, or splash out on the latest European fashions. With oil exports in Iraq at a 30-year high (August's revenues were $8.4 billion), a lot of well-positioned people are getting extremely wealthy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/\">More: Get latest news at CNN Election HQ</a></p>\n<p>Here there is a vague understanding of the two different candidates for those that watch the international Arab language channels such as Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya.

I don't know his policy but when I see his face he looks like the devil.\"</p>\n<p>The most nuanced view, however, comes from Sheikh Jawad Al-Khalisi, a highly respected Shiite religious leader: \"There's not a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. I don't trust either candidate because they are both influenced by lobbyists. U.S. policy is actually against the American people. In 2003 Americans protested against the war, but they weren't heard.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2012/05/22/opinion/delhi-postcard/index.html\">Postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election</a></p>\n<p>Baghdadis don't trust U.S. politicians, but neither do they trust their own. \"The government is full of thieves,\" 23-year-old Karar tells me in his home in Hurriya, a dangerous neighborhood in northwest Baghdad. Corruption, in fact, is what most Baghdadis talk about when they talk politics. Iraq's parliament is in a constant state of dysfunction; warring coalitions block each other at every turn and assassinations and police brutality are used as political tools.</p>\n<p>Karar doesn't care for politics. He's a college kid whose life is dominated by working, studying, and just surviving. A year ago he was injured in a bomb attack in his neighborhood and then just a few weeks ago another bomb went off near his house, killing three of his friends.</p>\n<p>Karar tells me all of this in a very matter-of-fact way, and I ask him why he seems so unaffected by it. \"I feel sad. I'm so sorry about their families. But what can I do? This is normal for us. If you see your friend today, you don't see him tomorrow.\" As he pauses, the electricity cuts out and the ceiling fan stops turning.</p>\n<p>Even with the oil exports, new cars, and imported fashions, basic services in Baghdad are still terrible. On average Baghdadis receive eight to 12 hours of national electricity a day, which makes life in the summer -- when temperatures easily reach 120 degrees -- almost unbearable.</p>\n<p>Even in September, once the ceiling fan has stopped rotating, the room immediately begins to heat up. Karar gestures at everyone sitting in the room sweating and he finally answers my question about what he thinks of the U.S. election. \"I don't think that a change of American presidents will have any effect on Iraq,\" he says and then a huge grin spreads across his face and he starts to laugh that unique, resilient Baghdadi laugh.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/12/world/meast/baghdad-postcard/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a href=\"#cnn-disqus-area\">Comments &raquo;</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">More sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Baghdad has little faith in election","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":509,"body":"Adele welcomes a baby boy, George Clooney is honored at the Carousel of Hope Ball, and Valerie Bertinelli talks food.","title":"Adele welcomes baby boy","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":510,"body":"Fmr.

Only 6% chose \"foreign policy and the Middle East\" in an<a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm\"> NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.</a> CBS News/New York Times posed an open-ended version of the same question -- foreign affairs did not even make the list of the top 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/rothkopf-foreign-policy-debate/index.html\">Opinion: Obama's foreign policy on trial</a></p>\n\n\nDavid Gergen\n\n<p>But the debates have transformed the election landscape. With the race in a dead heat 15 days from the election and this debate their final moment together, both candidates are scrambling to make their closing arguments to voters they still need. And even though Monday night is ostensibly about America's role in a jumbled world, they will surely seize upon it to serve domestic ends.</p>\n<p>For President Obama, this is a major opportunity to hone in on the group that may be most important to his election: women. As pointed out by Ron Brownstein, one of the nation's best students of the interplay of politics and demography, Obama can win the election if he wins over more college-educated women in the Southeast and <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/why-obama-is-leading-in-swing-states-20121001]\">more non-college educated women in the upper Midwest</a>. He has already made<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/why-obama-is-relying-on-the-rustbelt-instead-of-the-sunbelt/263926/\"> strong inroads with both</a>, but needs a little more heft.</p>\n<p>Obama's best way to do that is to convince women that he will not only protect our security but he will keep us out of war. He has argued in the past that he is doing just that by getting bin Laden and by extracting the U.S. from Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>He can advance his case by arguing that tough sanctions have led the United States and its allies to edge much closer to talks with Iran, which could defuse the possibility of an armed conflict. Presumably, the story leaked by the administration to The New York Times over the weekend <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html?_r=2&\">about new talks with Iran</a> was intended to set up exactly that conversation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/world/debate-foreign-policy/index.html\">How foreign policy hits close to home</a></p>\n<p>The Obama people also realize that they are presenting Romney with a tricky choice: either he can agree with Obama that more talks with Iran would be wise before any bombs fall, or he can take a harder line on Iran. The first choice risks Romney saying \"me-too,\" but the second might make him seem just too bellicose -- George W. Bush revisited. Either way, he has to avoid that trap. Similar tough questions surround other issues, especially the growing dispute over whether the U.S. should intervene in Syria, a civil war spilling over into Turkey and Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For Romney, a key imperative Monday night is to find a way to drum in his central message: He will be better than Obama in creating jobs, taming the deficits, and growing the economy.</p>\n<p>On the surface, a foreign policy debate doesn't lend itself to that message. But a clever candidate could find a way to argue that the biggest threat to America's national security is economic weakness and demoralization at home. Military leaders stretching back to Eisenhower have successfully argued that peace comes through strength -- both in arms and in the economy.</p>\n<p>It has been clear for some time that Obama and Romney are running increasingly different campaigns. Obama is tailoring messages and actions to groups that make up his coalition: women, minorities and youth.</p>\n<p>Romney, on the other hand, is trying to win through a single message aimed at all: I can turn this economy around.</p>\n<p>Each will try to advance their messaging strategies during the debate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/advice-rosen-cain-debate/index.html\">Opinion: Obama, explain; Romney, chill the tough talk</a></p>\n<p>Finally, this last debate also presents an opportunity to detail who would be a better commander-in-chief. Obama has held a strong upper hand on this question throughout most of the campaign but since the first debate -- as in other areas -- Romney is closing in.</p>\n<p>U.S. elections are rarely won on a particular foreign policy issue, but voters do care whether they feel confident and secure about the person in the White House who gets the 3 a.m. phone call. Obama has come a long way in burnishing those credentials since his candidacy of four years ago. But recent turmoil in the Middle East, and White House handling of it, has caused some uneasiness.</p>\n<p>Romney, meanwhile, has often been clumsy on foreign affairs -- remember his ill-fated trip to Europe this past summer. But he has seems to have steadied a bit since then.</p>\n<p>So, even though foreign policy issues rank low among the priorities of most American voters, the debate has emerged as yet another critical moment on the long, nail-biting race to November.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/takiff-candidates-desperate/index.html\">Opinion: When presidential candidates get

an artist and is now billed as one of New York's most promising new talents.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old Nigerian-born artist has just completed a year-long residence with the prestigious <a

character in my work,\" she said. \"A lot of my work is about investigating my love for Nigeria and my life in America.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"I met my husband at college and there was some anxiety that if I married outside my culture I would lose my identity, but there is a space in my work where these things come together.\"</p>\n<p>Akunyili is hoping to help change attitudes to art in Nigeria, where she said appreciation is growing slowly.</p>\n<p>\"If I hadn't left Nigeria, I wouldn't be an artist, I would be a doctor,\" she said. \"When I told my parents I wanted to be an artist, they couldn't get their heads around why an educated person who went to college in America would want to be an artist.</p>\n<p>\"If people think of artists, it's somebody by the side of the road

Nigerian artists were successful internationally, but few were well known within the country.</p>\n<p>\"However, there is a new crop of creative Nigerians who are changing this and others will follow,\" she said. \"I want to be part of that change.\"</p>\n<p>She said the country had seen a \"cultural explosion\" in the last 10 years in music, fashion, film and other creative industries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"Artist\">See hi-res gallery of Akunyili's images</a></p>\n<p>\"When I was young, the less Nigerian you were the cooler you were, but now we have gone back to tradition,\"

How was it made? Why was it made?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2012/10/19/ted-campbell-museum-gallery-narrative.ted\">Watch Thomas Campbell's TED Talk</a></p>\n<p>I would later apply these questions to the field of tapestries, a neglected area of art history despite the central role these objects played in the past as a potent form of propaganda.</p>\n<p>I came to the Met as a curator in 1995 and set out to organize a groundbreaking show about Renaissance tapestry. I designed my 2002 exhibition to be an experience, a spectacle of wall-high images saturating the galleries with lavish court scenes, hunters crashing through thick woods in pursuit of their prey, and violent battles depicted in a medium that was the IMAX of its time. The success of the show was gratifying; I had exposed the public to something they had never before considered.</p>\n\n\n<b>Become a fan of CNNOpinion</b>\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media.

Instead of an extensive shop-window display, it was an immersive journey into the mind of a man who was not just a clothing designer, but a storyteller, filmmaker and conceptual artist.</p>\n\n\n\n\nA display from the exhibition \"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty,\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2011. \n\n<p>The research and vision of Met curator Andrew Bolton brought that complexity forward and made the exhibition exceptionally moving for our visitors, many of whom waited over five hours to see it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_how_art_technology_and_design_inform_creative_leaders.html\">TED.com: How art, technology and design inform creative leaders</a></p>\n<p>Individual objects in the Met's collection can have the same power as these major exhibitions. The Met was established in 1870 not as a museum of American art, but as an encyclopedic museum, and it now includes works of art from every corner of the globe.</p>\n<p>Today, the prescience of that founding mandate is felt more than ever as 24-hour news coverage has us digesting the world at an ever-quickening pace. The works of art in the Met's galleries allow people to slow down that cycle, tap into a broader historical context and better understand the cultures at the center of current events. Think of Libya, Syria and Egypt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/aparna_rao_high_tech_art_with_a_sense_of_humor.html\">TED.com: High tech art with a sense of humor</a></p>\n\n\n\n\nThe 2000-year-old Temple of Dendur is displayed in the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\n<p>Daily, our visitors confront objects like the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100004628\">Temple of Dendur</a> from c.15 BC, an ancient Egyptian structure built by the Roman Emperor Augustus, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted as a pharaoh (politicians still use regional traditions, though now that means eating cheese steaks).</p>\n<p>To see this structure — its actual stones carved by hand and surviving two millennia — now sitting alongside traffic passing through Central Park speaks powerfully about the passage of time and the longevity of human civilization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/alwar_balasubramaniam_sculpture_of_substance_and_absence.html\">TED.com: Art of substance and absence</a></p>\n<p>If visitors look closely, they can see 18th-century graffiti left by European travelers who over 200 years ago considered this object with the same awe. Suddenly, our moment in history seems tiny.</p>\n<p>Certainly our <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/islamic-art\">galleries for Islamic art</a> also make this point. Opened 10 years after 9/11, almost to the day, and tracing the development of Islamic cultures over 14 centuries and across a vast geographic expanse, these galleries have received more than 800,000 visitors since they opened a year ago, a resounding endorsement of both the power of actual objects in a virtual world and the public interest in a culture that had little resonance for many Americans before the 2001 tragedy.</p>\n<p>In the end, I want the Met to be a place where people meet not only with friends or on a date, but with works of art across time and space.</p>\n<p>But let's face it, museums can be intimidating, and spending time being intimidated is exhausting.</p>\n<p>Museums can also be boring if you feel like this old stuff has nothing to do with you. My job is to relax our visitors so they can sense a connection, get excited, explore, try the unknown and follow their curiosity. That means ditching the jargon, but not the scholarship, and getting to the real work of inspiring the public to look around and find themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas P.

Rumors and leaks have been plentiful ahead of the announcement, as they were for last month's iPhone 5 unveiling, but there's still the potential for a few surprises.</p>\n<p>All signs point to a smaller iPad with specifications similar to the iPad 2. The two models might turn out to have an iPhone/iPod touch relationship, with the smaller iPad always one generation behind in the features department. That means it won't have a Retina screen just yet, though it will probably sport the new Lightning connector port.<a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/10/16/ipad-mini-skus-reveal-apple-will-release-12-models-in-two-colors\"> A recent Apple Insider report</a> shows 12 possible configurations, dabbling in different memory sizes (from 8GB to 64GB), connection options (WiFi or WiFi + cellular) and colors (black or white).</p>\n<p>Naming is one of the few things Apple still excels at keeping secret, as it did when it confusingly called the third iPad simply \"the new iPad.\" While \"iPad Mini\" has been a popular guess thus far, \"iPad Air\" has also been floating around as a potential moniker for the device.</p>\n<p>This being Apple, there's always the possibility of additional announcements. Rumors include Apple making a minor update to the larger iPad line with the Lightning connecter, the addition of a Retina screen to the 13-inch Macbook Pro, and an update to the iMac and Mac Mini designs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The centerpiece, however, will be the wee iPad. Apple's full-sized iPad has been a huge success and still dominates the overall tablet market, so why go small now?</p>\n<p>The biggest demand for non-Apple tablets has been for less expensive 7-inch devices such as Amazon's Kindle Fire, Samsung's Galaxy Tab, Google's Nexus 7 and Barnes and Noble's Nook. A smaller iPad would challenge these competitors head on, combining their popular size with Apple's killer features: the iOS operating system, Apple's app and media ecosystem, and quality design.</p>\n<p>The Kindle Fire is great for buying books, movies and shows from Amazon, and the Nexus 7 has Google's well-stocked Play store for media and apps. However, tablets have proven they can do more than just entertain, and customers might be drawn to the quality and quantity of Apple's App Store selection. Developers have been creating top-notch apps for the iPad for more than two years. The smaller iPad's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio, so those apps would work the same on the new device.</p>\n<p>When the iPad came out, it was intended to be a consumption device. Ads for the tablet showed people reclining in various environments, clutching the iPad like a book. The spacious 10-inch screen was ideal for watching movies and TV shows, playing games, surfing the Web and otherwise consuming content.</p>\n<p>That's how most tablet owners use their devices. Tablets are homebodies, used most often in the living room (30% of the time according to Nielsen) followed by the bedroom (21% of the time).</p>\n<p>\"Fully half the time they're using tablets, they don't leave the couch or the bed,\" said Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps. \"If you can do everything on the smaller iPad you can on the larger iPad -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of Amazon.\"</p>\n<p>A smaller, lighter device is more portable, and people might not be as afraid of taking a cheaper tablet out into the big bad world where it would be less protected. That would also be a boost for Apple in the education market, which it has been courting heavily.</p>\n<p>How much cheaper the smaller iPad will be is uncertain. Price predictions have been all over the map this rumor cycle, but the general consensus is that they will cost less than the current $500 iPad (the older iPad 2 is still being sold for $400), and be slightly more expensive than competing 7-inch products.</p>\n<p>\"[Apple] can take part of the lower end of the market, but they don't have to reach all the way to the bottom to be successful,\" said Rotman Epps.</p>\n<p>Apple customers have proven they are willing to pay a premium for their products.</p>\n<p>The decision to make a smaller device is a change of heart for the company. Apple prides itself on designing products people didn't even know they wanted. Apple's late chief executive Steve Jobs told BusinessWeek in 1998, \"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.\"</p>\n<p>That's what Apple did when it released the 9.7-inch iPad in 2010. The tablet has gone on to sell more than 84 million units, including the original iPad, the iPad 2 and the third-generation iPad.</p>\n<p>Jobs infamously dismissed 7-inch tablets in an earnings call later that same year, calling them \"dead on arrival,\" going on to say the size was \"too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad.\" Now it seems the company is changing its tune and listening to the demands of the masses, in addition to trying to predict what they'll want next.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/23/tech/mobile/apple-goes-small/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a href=\"#cnn-disqus-area\">Comments &raquo;</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">More sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"What to expect at Apple's event","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":530,"body":"CNN's Hala Gorani reports on new video that shows the moment the car bomb in Beirut exploded.","title":"Watch moment of Beirut car bombing","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":531,"body":"Getting paid big money to travel the world in luxury would be many people's idea of the dream job.

Ms Merkel said she was determined to revive Germany's flagging growth, not least because of the country's role \"to do something for the stimulation of the economy in Europe\".</p>\n<p>Eurozone leaders have called for tougher austerity measures in both Spain and Greece, even as their economies shrink rapidly. Both countries are expected to be discussed at a high-profile summit of EU leaders next week.</p>\n<p>Ms Lagarde advocated giving Greece two more years to hit the tough budget targets contained in its €174bn bailout programme, becoming the most senior official publicly to back to a request from the government in Athens this summer.</p>\n<p>Europeans are braced for a new age of austerity as governments across the region take action to eliminate unsustainable budget deficits</p>\n<p>Her call for slower adjustment, coupled with a highly symbolic visit to Athens by Ms Merkel is a boost to Greece, which is trying to persuade its eurozone partners to give it more time. However, slower deficit reduction in Athens would mean Greece's international creditors would have to give it more help in a politically fraught overhaul of Greece's bailout programme.</p>\n<p>Ms Lagarde said she also supported the European Commission's decision to give Spain another year to bring its budget deficit down to 3 per cent of economic output but she would not comment on whether Madrid should ask for extra financial assistance from the EU.</p>\n<p>José Viñals, head of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, appeared to warn Berlin against blocking any Spanish request for assistance. Mr Schäuble has insisted that Madrid does not need additional financing aid even as Brussels has been pushing it to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>Mr Viñals, in an interview with Reuters, said creditor countries, including Germany, should not \"negate\" a Spanish request that would activate the European Central Bank's new bond-buying assistance programme, bringing down Spanish borrowing costs.

HIGHLIGHTS</strong>\n<ul>\n\n<li>The debate wasn't only a clash of ideas; it was a contrast of styles, say contributors </li>\n<li>Tim Stanley: Candidates were in different worlds, pugnacious Biden vs. wonkish Ryan</li>\n<li>Paul Begala: Calling Romney-Ryan's plans \"malarkey\" was a home run for Democrats</li>\n<li>Julian Zelizer: Both sides will be able to boast about their candidates' performance</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- <i>Vice President Joe Biden met his challenger, Rep. Paul Ryan, Thursday night in Danville, Kentucky, for the vice presidential debate. CNN contributors and analysts offered these assessments of the evening:</i></p>\n<p><strong>Timothy Stanley: Debate was sports bar vs. seminar</strong></p>\n<p>This was a strange debate, even an ugly one. The two men looked like they were taking part in separate discussions. Ryan was speaking in the economics seminar at some obscure think tank. Biden was shouting answers in the middle of a loud sports bar.</p>\n\n\nTimothy Stanley\n\n<p>The tone was so uneven that the candidates seemed to find each other's presence a nuisance -- Biden laughed his way through Ryan's answers and Ryan was often visibly irritated. The most surreal moment was when Biden picked a fight with the moderator, Martha Raddatz, about the Afghanistan War. We've never seen him this pugnacious.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it was a draw. Liberals will probably appreciate that Biden did what Obama failed to do last week: He took the debate to the Republicans and called out their \"malarkey.\" But moderate voters might take offense at his combative tone, which often bordered on rude. By contrast, Ryan's softer, more wonkish style might strike floating voters as weak. But he could also score among those looking for calm and reason rather than heated rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Biden excelled when attacking Ryan on Romney's flip-flops and failure to commit to specific spending cuts. Ryan excelled when talking about his beloved Medicare and tax plans. Both men displayed thoughtfulness and humanity in the question of abortion, which pitted different traditions of Catholicism against one another.</p>\n<p>Ryan said his faith and his public policy were inseparable; Biden refused to compel others to adhere to Catholic doctrine. Again, how the voter reacts to those answers will depend on their prejudices. This debate wasn't about persuasion. It was about drawing contrasts and playing to the cameras. As a result, it probably wasn't the game changer that either side was looking for.</p>\n<p><i>Timothy Stanley is a historian at Oxford University and blogs for Britain's The Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \"The Crusader: The Life and Times of Pat Buchanan.\"</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/12/politics/debate-five-things-learned/index.html\">Politics: Five things we learned from the VP debate</a></p>\n\n\nPaul Begala\n\n<p><strong>Paul Begala: Biden's \"malarkey\" line sums it up</strong></p>\n<p>I sometimes think the definition of a Democrat is someone who is afraid to take his own side in a fight.</p>\n<p>Malarkey.</p>\n<p>With that one word, spoken in the opening minutes of the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden signaled he was fighting back. Biden gave the Democrats the debate they needed. He grabbed Paul Ryan by the scruff of his neck and gave him a thorough thrashing.</p>\n<p>Biden pounced on Ryan for seeking to cut funding for embassy security, even as he played politics with the terror attack on our consulate in Benghazi. The Malarkey Moment surprised Ryan and energized Biden. Perhaps smelling blood in the water, Biden kept Ryan on his heels for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>Ryan gulped water as Biden spoke, and Biden smiled (sometimes you could tell it was forced) as Ryan talked. And for all the times they called each other \"my friend\" and said, \"with all due respect,\" both candidates had a tone of exasperation at times.</p>\n<p>Biden hammered Ryan and Romney for sneering at a giant percentage of Americans. Ryan has called as many as 40% of our fellow citizens \"takers.\" Yet he more than once spoke of his family's dependence on Social Security and Medicare. Biden wouldn't let him get away with it. Finally, it got to Ryan, who snarled, \"I know you're under a lot of duress.\" Whoa, sonny-boy, watch the snark. You're getting your butt kicked, and it shows.</p>\n<p>The Obama campaign released a photo of President Obama watching the debate. Good. The president was criticized for being too passive in the first debate. Some may criticize Biden for being too aggressive in this one. So be it. But I loved his performance, and I bet the president did as well.</p>\n<p><i>Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, is senior adviser to Priorities USA Action, the biggest super PAC favoring President Barack Obama's re-election. Begala was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House.</i></p>\n\n\nAna Navarro\n\n<p><strong>Ana Navarro: What Obama could learn from Biden</strong></p>\n<p>I'm a Republican pundit. I'm supposed to write that Paul Ryan crushed Joe Biden and turned him into dust in tonight's debate. But I've accidentally consumed some truth serum. I saw this as draw. Both Biden and Ryan were prepared, well practiced and brought their A game to the table. The campaign spinners are going to make the case their respective candidates won. In my book, they both scored victories.</p>\n<p>Biden won because unlike President Obama in the first debate, Biden did not clearly, unequivocally lose. He stopped the bleeding for his camp. Had Biden followed in Obama's example and given a lackluster performance, it would have been the fatal blow. Instead, Obama lives to fight another day.</p>\n<p>Ryan also came out victorious. He shared the stage with a sitting vice president and one of he most veteran politicians in America and held his own. Ryan went toe to toe with the vice president, even when discussing foreign policy, Biden's strength. Despite his youth, Ryan looked vice presidential. He debated a man who could easily be his father, but they sat there as equals and on even footing.</p>\n<p>Neither of them blinked or ceded an inch. Both of them came armed with facts and figures but also gave us a view into their personal side. This was a good debate for Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, and also for the American people. We got to see the two sides passionately advocate distinct positions. There is no muddled gray area here.</p>\n<p>Folks, buckle up! We have a tight race in our hands. The vice presidential debate has made the next presidential debate that much more crucial. If President Obama hopes to reverse the tide, he could stand to learn a few lessons from his vice president. For starters, show up not only in body, but also in soul. Engage your opponent, better yet, look at him. Challenge the statements you think are inaccurate. Don't leave opportunities on the table. Don't just stand at the plate; swing at the balls pitched at you.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden was being compared to President Obama in the first debate. He vastly outperformed him. Paul Ryan was being compared to Joe Biden, and he stood his ground. The ball now goes back to Romney and Obama's court. A few months ago, some Democrats were fretting about whether it would be better to replace Biden on the ticket. If President Obama doesn't come out swinging and deliver an energetic performance in the next debate, Democrats might find themselves wondering if the wrong guy isn't on the top of the ticket.</p>\n<p><i>Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and commentator, served as national Hispanic campaign chairwoman for John McCain in 2008 and national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman's 2012 campaign.

They were spoken not by either of the candidates, but by the moderator, Martha Raddatz.</p>\n<p>She prefaced her thoughts by saying she knew that both men had great respect for the people who serve in the military. And then she said:</p>\n<p>\"I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, 'The ads are so negative, and they are all tearing down each other rather than building up the country.' What would you say to that American hero about this campaign, and at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?\"</p>\n<p>The answers given by Joe Biden and Paul Ryan -- serious in tenor -- were not as stirring as the question itself, because unless you are a professional political operative whose job it is to attack the other side, you recognize the wisdom in that soldier's words. Raddatz did not mention what the soldier's political allegiance was, and it would have been beside the point. What mattered is that he is an American, and he believes that much of the tone of the campaign has been beneath the dignity of what Americans should expect.</p>\n<p>Biden repeatedly referred to Ryan as \"my friend\"; Ryan, at the end of the proceedings, thanked Biden -- he referred to him as \"Joe\" -- and said it had been an honor to debate him.</p>\n<p>People tend to accord each other that kind of courtesy when they have to look each other in the eye. Friday morning, though, the ad wars will resume, like bombing raids conducted from two miles in the air.

And Martha Raddatz proved that moderators can -- and should -- moderate. Paul Ryan showed that talking points, an engaging personality and a few personal anecdotes can't mask bad policy, misinformation and ignorance.</p>\n<p>Paul Ryan attempted to dominate the conversation -- a bullying tactic he took from Romney's playbook and that clearly irritated Biden. He rattled off misleading information, half-truths and cooked-up numbers. He made unsubstantiated claims about President Obama, the effects of his policies, both here and abroad, and ignored the context of the last four years: the \"Great Recession\" and Republican congressional obstructionism. Biden successfully challenged them all.</p>\n<p>Raddatz pressed both candidates for specifics and would not be bulldozed. She kept the debate moving, didn't let it deteriorate (too much), and asked hard questions. At various points, both candidates were uncomfortable; both Biden and Ryan had \"I don't want to answer that\" moments. That's a sign the moderator was doing her job. For the most part, she let them debate, but acted as guide and, well, moderator. It's a tough line moderators have to walk, but Martha Raddatz did it as well as anybody.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden came prepared to argue, to debate and to be Joe. He didn't allow the \"less than candid\" Republican claims to go unchallenged. When Ryan brought up \"values,\" Biden brought up \"responsibility,\" and the disdain Romney and Ryan have for 47% (or 30%) of the American people. He even countered Ryan's reference to his \"gaffes,\" replying, \"I always say what I mean.\"</p>\n<p>Ryan was salesman smooth and knew his talking points. Biden was passionate and \"fired up.\" Ryan talked; Biden shared experience. Both men could argue, but only Biden was intense -- because he spoke -- and frowned and gestured and smiled - from his heart as well as his mind.</p>\n<p>A young woman, in her early twenties, wrote me after the debate that Joe Biden inspired her with his fervor and honesty to register and to vote.</p>\n<p>Yes, this debate mattered.

If he was downright rude, according to many in the Twitterverse, he got a pass from the president's supporters, who can only hope they see this offense from the commander-in-chief next week. Biden tried to dominate the debate, lost on style and stumbled on substance.</p>\n<p>Ryan seemed less confident on foreign policy at the beginning, but recovered on Afghanistan, where he's visited twice and had a personal anecdote to illustrate his time in Helmand Province. I wish he'd called Biden out when he accused Ryan of voting to \"to put two wars on a credit card.\" Biden, too, voted for both wars. The high water mark of the performance was Ryan's fancy footwork early that took 47%-gate off the table in quipping, \"I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\" Even Biden had to chuckle.</p>\n<p>This split screen captured the contrast in visions of the two vice presidential candidates on fiscal policy. Appropriately on the left, older Joe Biden, defending big government and modern liberalism's spending and fiscal denial with a grinning fresh face offering new ideas for fiscal reform and longevity from the right.</p>\n<p>Ryan was classy to thank the vice president for the debate, even after having been smirked at for the previous 90 minutes. But Biden's graciousness to Ryan's mother once the microphones were cut portrayed his interpersonal warmth that plays so well on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>I think Ryan had the advantage on substance and style. In a national race where both guys are second runner-up, this is effectively a draw for how it plays into the larger campaign narratives.</p>\n<p><i>Margaret Hoover is the author of \"American Individualism: How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party.\"</i></p>\n\n\nWilliam Howell\n\n<p><strong>William Howell: Ryan's challenge was bigger, and he met it</strong></p>\n<p>No great surprise, Joe Biden delivered tonight. On the heels of his boss' withering performance last week, the vice president demonstrated his deep knowledge of domestic and foreign policy issues, fluidly maneuvering between minutiae about tax policy and the draw-down in Afghanistan on the one hand and meta-arguments about the stakes involved in this election on the other. He also scored his share of style points.</p>\n<p>Though all that laughing through those big pearly whites proved a bit unnerving at times, Biden exhibited his relish for a good debate and his conviction in essential liberal principles. The Democratic base is surely pleased.</p>\n<p>It was Paul Ryan, though, who faced the bigger challenge. Ryan had to prove his commitment to ideas and principles that are not entirely of his choosing. During the primaries, when Romney was brandishing his conservative credentials, this task would have been easily met. But going into this debate, it was not clear that the darling among the conservative right would be able to square his views with those of the more moderate incarnation of the former governor of deep-blue Massachusetts. But well he did.</p>\n<p>Disciplined, substantive and on point, Ryan effectively thwarted efforts by Biden to drive a wedge between the congressman's former voting record and the policy positions of the Romney-Ryan ticket. He performed as well as his party could possibly have hoped.</p>\n<p>This debate is not likely to move the polls much at all. But that is not to say that it is entirely inconsequential. For at least the coming week, Democrats can now talk about something other than their president's detachment. And Republicans generally, but Romney in particular, can rest assured that the GOP presidential ticket is in order as they settle on a consistent message to push through Election Day.</p>\n<p><i>William Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago.</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/12/politics/debate-raddatz/index.html\">Who won the VP debate? Martha Raddatz</a></p>\n\n\nMaria Cardona\n\n<p><strong>Maria Cardona: Pressure is on the next two debates </strong></p>\n<p>This was one of the best vice presidential debates I've seen. The pressure was on Vice President Joe Biden to deliver a great performance -- and deliver he did.</p>\n<p>Biden was assertive and aggressive, and he didn't let any untruth or distortion coming out of Paul Ryan's mouth slide.</p>\n<p>From Medicare to taxes to Iran to Afghanistan to the 47% to abortion, Biden did not miss an opportunity and was as clear as he could have been on how President Obama would be on the side of middle-class families, seniors, women and those most vulnerable in our society. He was factual and specific. His years of experience in the Senate showed as he commanded the stage with his expertise.</p>\n<p>Rep. Paul Ryan held his own, didn't make any mistakes and was prepared. But he was outwitted by Biden and challenged by the moderator Martha Raddatz when he was being vague.</p>\n<p>Ryan's weakest moments came when he was pressed for specifics. He seemed demure on the issue of what loopholes he would close or how he and Mitt Romney would pay for the tax cuts and defense spending increases they are proposing. Raddatz pushed him on these points, and he did not have a satisfactory answer. In some instances, whether it was on economic issues or Iran, Ryan was not able to say what he and Romney would do differently.</p>\n<p>Biden came across as more authentic, much more passionate and as a guy who is a real champion of the middle class. Moreover, Biden was able to stop the bleeding, get Democrats excited about the next two debates and inject some much needed energy and optimism coming out of the doldrums from last week's presidential debate.</p>\n<p>Did the debate change any minds? Probably not. It seems Republicans are happy with Ryan's performance just as Democrats are happy with Biden's.</p>\n<p>What this means is that the remaining two presidential debates take on even more importance for how this race will continue to play out.

He looked like what he was -- an earnest, intelligent, over-coached, comparatively inexperienced chairman of the Budget Committee.</p>\n<p>Moderator Martha Raddatz had perhaps the best debate, especially compared to the unfocused Jim Lehrer; she actually asked pointed questions and follow-ups.</p>\n<p>And it was there that the campaign spin had to surrender to stats and facts. Ryan is a budget expert, but he either didn't want to acknowledge or didn't know his own campaign's proposal to increase military spending to 4% of GDP, adding $2 trillion in federal spending over 10 years and blowing a hole in their deficit reduction rhetoric. Likewise, questions about what specifically a Romney-Ryan administration would do differently about Syria, Iran or Afghanistan went essentially unanswered despite the flurry of words.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden made his share of unforced errors -- interrupting Ryan far too much and getting so overheated at one point that he turned his frustration against the moderator in an awkward spate of finger-pointing.</p>\n<p>Ryan also shined in his discussion of deficits and debts, contrasting the president's speeches with score-able policy. His closing statement was disarming and compelling.</p>\n<p>The best moment in terms of style and substance was Raddatz's question about abortion and the candidates' shared Catholic faith. Both men gave serious, thoughtful answers on this most difficult of subjects -- but Ryan's anti-abortion agenda contrasted to Biden's belief that he could not impose his personal religious views on an individual woman's decision. It was an eloquent defense of the separation of church and state -- a core concept we have heard too little about in recent years.</p>\n<p>This debate might not get as many viewers as the 70 million Americans who tuned in to the Biden-Palin debate in 2008 -- but it was far more substantive, energetic and serious. It was a great debate -- simultaneously civil and contentious -- the kind we need more of in the United States.</p>\n<p>Biden's strong performance gave the Democrats a much needed shot in the arm, a compelling defense of their values and beliefs that will buoy their sagging morale and change the narrative going into the second presidential debate on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It might not have changed many undecided minds, but it changed the momentum -- and that's a win in our democracy circa 2012.</p>\n<p><i>John Avlon is a senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast.

Paul Ryan engaged in a vigorous debate, with a moderator who kept pushing the discussion along.</p>\n<p>Both sides will find something in the debate that they can boast about. Ryan demonstrated he could debate policy areas where he is not as experienced, particularly foreign policy, and he handled himself well before the television cameras. He remained calm under fire. Ryan was also able to tell a few personal stories that he used to try to humanize the image of his running mate.</p>\n<p>For Democrats, who needed a much bigger boost, Biden came through in that he was much more aggressive than Obama was in last week's debate, hammering away at Republican economic policies, warning voters about his opponent's Medicare plan and defending the administration's actions overseas. Biden consistently raised questions about whether Ryan and the Republicans are even telling the truth when they speak. During the last segment of the debate, Biden seemed to be at his strongest, a Democrat who was tough on national security and someone who was on firmer ground than his opponent with regard to understanding these challenges. Biden said what many Democrats wanted President Obama to say against Romney, showing the enthusiasm and the fire that was absent last week.</p>\n<p>There are some viewers who might have been turned off by Biden's tendency to laugh and shake his head in dismissive fashion as Ryan was speaking. The danger for Democrats is that some swing voters read this as arrogance and partisanship rather than a sign of Biden's comfort before the cameras.</p>\n<p>Like other vice presidential debates, this one probably won't have much of an impact on the electorate, though it will help curb some of the media discussion about Obama's poor first performance and generate some excitement among Democrats who were left deflated after Denver. Finally, both candidates handled themselves well enough that it probably won't have any major effect on their fortunes if they choose to run for the presidency in 2016.</p>\n<p><i>Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.

The entire discussion centered on Medicare. For all the bluster between the two campaigns, the differences between them on that program for the next decade are small.</p>\n<p>For all the talk about the financial risk Medicare holds, neither wants to cut it severely soon. On Medicaid, however, the<a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1379004\"> differences are stark</a>; that program didn't come up at all.</p>\n<p>I also was appalled that raising the Medicare age of eligibility was tossed off as an obvious thing to do.

W.

He ain't stupid.\"</p>\n<p>In 1988, Michael Dukakis, astonished that a majority of the electorate seemed to swallow the Bush campaign's depiction of him as a liberal oddball, released a series of commercials purporting to show a group of Bush political consultants. In each spot, the operatives sought to deflect attention from their own candidate's shortcomings by unleashing yet another scurrilous attack on Dukakis. The ads made perfect sense to Democrats but were so indirect in making their point as to have little impact.</p>\n<p>With the current contest neck-and-neck just two weeks before Election Day, neither candidate is sure he's about to lose -- but neither is sure he isn't. And so both candidates are showing signs of desperation, both incredulous that the American people might actually award the presidency to a man clearly undeserving of the job, both fearing they're about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>\n<p>President Obama, only a couple of weeks ago appearing to be on the verge of a near-landslide, has taken to suggesting that his opponent suffers from \"Romnesia.\" Mitt Romney, still a slight underdog in a race he and his party had long assumed would be theirs thanks to the nation's sluggish economy, sought at last week's debate to trap the president in a misstatement regarding the recent attack on Americans in Libya.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/rothkopf-foreign-policy-debate/index.html\">Opinion: Obama's foreign policy on trial</a></p>\n<p>Will Obama's new jokey stump speech succeed in reminding female voters that Romney's current modulated positions on reproductive choice bear no resemblance to those he expressed during his campaign for the GOP's nomination? Or will the president's engaging in ridicule boomerang to make himself, not his opponent, seem small?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Romney's Libya gambit blew up in his face when Candy Crowley corrected his error. Will he try to resuscitate the argument at Monday's foreign-policy debate in Boca Raton, Florida? If so, will he succeed in convincing the public that the president is a man out of his depth? Or will such persistence merely confirm the Obama campaign's argument that the former governor is a man unashamed to capitalize on a tragic loss of life in order to make a political point?</p>\n<p>I'm sure Romney is not waiting with bated breath for my advice, but here it is: He should back off on Libya.</p>\n<p>In times not dominated by threats from abroad, a presidential candidate need not prove foreign-policy wizardry but must only pass a threshold of credibility -- call it the 3 a.m. test, after Hillary Clinton's famous commercial in 2008 imagining her taking a call at that hour informing her of a sudden international crisis.</p>\n<p>The governor should recall 1992. As it is today, in that year, national security was seen as the incumbent's strong suit; indeed, George H. W. Bush's leadership of Desert Storm in early 1991 had earned him stratospheric approval ratings that they caused some of the Democratic Party's biggest names to pass up challenging him, believing any such attempt to be futile.</p>\n<p>Clinton knew better. He sensed that with the end of the Cold War world, he could wage and win a campaign centered on the economy, as long as he convinced the public that he would be knowledgeable and sensible in matters of foreign policy. In a number of areas -- notably Haiti, China, and the Balkans -- he staked out positions advocating more active intervention than the Bush administration was pursuing.</p>\n<p>Clinton's aim was not to best Bush on foreign policy -- he did not deride Bush as a foreign-policy lightweight, a characterization he knew would convince no one -- but rather to fight the incumbent to a draw. And he did. Indeed, by conceding Bush's prowess at foreign affairs, Clinton turned it against him, contrasting the president's activism abroad with his apparent passivity at home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/zelizer-presidential-debate/index.html\">Opinion: Dems' national security advantage at risk</a></p>\n<p>With his Libya gambit, Romney is making the mistake Clinton didn't. Obama got bin Laden; Romney can't do anything about that, and his repeated talk of the president's supposed apology tours may play well to the Republican base conditioned to seeing Obama as an anti-American con man but not to independent voters who have seen this president correct the foreign policy mistakes made by his predecessor. Romney's ventures into foreign policy to date have embarrassed him -- not only his goof in the town-hall debate but also his bumbling recent trip abroad.</p>\n<p>If he wants to turn Monday's foreign policy debate to his advantage, he will simply try to hold his own, to present himself as a credible commander in chief and a plausible face of America to the world. He should play it safe, attempting no more than to (barely) pass the foreign-policy threshold and thus put the issue aside. If he can do so -- meeting a standard made low, ironically, by the president's success in keeping threats to the nation at bay -- he will be able to focus his campaign endgame on what has always been, and remains, the sole issue that could win him the race: popular dissatisfaction with the state of the economy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Obama needs to assert not only his own skill and sobriety at foreign policy but also Romney's ineptitude and bellicosity, his \"blunder\" and \"bluster,\" as the Obama campaign is now putting it. If the president can stoke existing doubt over the governor's suitability to the international stage, he can add the issue to those he raised in the town hall and has been hammering since: tax fairness, women's health, the \"sketchy deal\" and the shifting, at some point, of nearly all of Romney's positions.</p>\n<p>Referendum or choice -- as they have all along, the two sides are still seeking to define just what voters will be going to the polls to do. The candidates -- and the rest of us -- are desperate to find out the answer.</p>\n\n<p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Takiff.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/22/opinion/takiff-candidates-desperate/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a href=\"#cnn-disqus-area\">Comments &raquo;</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">More sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"When candidates get desperate","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":551,"body":"Roland Martin: Evangelicals should stop pretending biblical convictions take precedence over their partisan views.","title":"When the bible, politics intersect","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":552,"body":"China has replaced America as the land of opportunity, says CNN's Stan Grant.

That's usually when it gears up, when everything comes to the forefront,\" said Melissa Reylek-Robinson, a 34-year-old mother of two in San Diego. \"Election time is probably the worst time for us.

But couples who have learned to successfully weather political partisanship could teach us all a thing or two about relationships in general, said etiquette expert Anna Post.</p>\n<p>\"These are admirable couples. It takes a lot of patience and passion and respect for the relationship, especially where large political divides exist,\" said Post, spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute and great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post. \"To be able to do that successfully speaks to the kind of relationship these couples have.\"</p>\n<p>Political differences don't always lead to political discord, she said, and shouldn't be considered insurmountable.

It's how you choose to bridge them that will create a problem or make things work smoothly, knowing how to have a dialogue and which boundaries not to push or cross.\"</p>\n<p>As a devout Christian and Republican who's also a Colts fan, Janet Davis is rarely on the same side as her significant other, an atheist Democrat who roots for the Patriots. After years of loud fights, it took the birth of their son to mellow them out.</p>\n<p>\"How do we do it? Very, very carefully,\" she said. \"No one really ever wins in a battle of personal beliefs. Since the birth of our son in 2005 we are both much more respectful of each other's viewpoints.\"</p>\n<p>Life-changing events like births or deaths can change a couple's perspective on what really matters in their relationship, said marriage and family therapist Sharon Rivkin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/18/health/kerner-politics-sex/index.html\">Political differences and the bedroom</a></p>\n<p>\"It's such a powerful experience that's bigger than the both of them,\" said Rivkin, author of \"Breaking the Argument Cycle.\" \"For many people, that's when they learn to respect each other, when you get down to the nitty-gritty of what's important.\"</p>\n<p>If a couple can coexist with different political views, it creates a foundation for a healthy and long-lasting relationship, psychotherapist Karen Ruskin said, because they've learned to see each other as two individuals within a relationship.</p>\n<p>\"For some people, they do not feel like individuals when they become married, they become one,\" she said. \"But that doesn't mean you have to share one position or one philosophy. It means you take care and look out for the other person as much as yourself. You love that person as much as that person loves you.\"</p>\n<p>It's not easy, she acknowledged, and probably impossible for someone who needs to always be right. It's a matter of learning to not be threatened by another position and accepting that what works for your partner doesn't have to work for you.</p>\n<p>Again, James Carville and Mary Matalin come to mind, she said. Their careers have grown over the years together even as they've worked on different sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of seeing it as conflicting you view it from the mental framework of acceptance, accepting that we have a difference in opinions,\" she said. \"In a healthy relationship, a difference in opinion does not define the relationship or erode it. It's another puzzle piece to fit into the relationship as a whole.\"</p>\n<p>Reylek-Robinson has learned to live with the \"the giant Bush in the room,\" as she likes to call her husband's photograph. He tolerates the fridge magnet she uses to display her children's homework depicting George W. Bush and his infamous quote, \"Rarely is the question asked, 'Is our children learning?' \"</p>\n<p>This year, the hot-button issue has been President Obama's Affordable Care Act, she said. As someone who has epilepsy, she said she supports \"Obamacare\" even though she has coverage through her husband.</p>\n<p>\"I have way too many pre-existing conditions and no one would touch me with a 10-foot pole if I didn't have his coverage. I wouldn't be able to afford all the medication I need if I had to get insurance without the Affordable Care Act,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Her husband doesn't think it should be mandatory, \"but we just agree to disagree.\"</p>\n<p>\"The fact that I believe in (government-mandated) health care and he doesn't is not something I'm going to divorce him over,\" she said. \"At the end of the day you have to realize that you love the person for things other than their political beliefs.\"</p>\n<p><i>Are you part of a politically divided couple?

As the eurozone's fourth largest economy -- making up around 11% of the currency bloc's gross domestic product -- its financial problems are now being exacerbated by defiance from some of its 17 disparate regions.</p>\n<p>Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region in the Northeast, represents one fifth of Spain's economy and the <a href=\"\">protestors are now actively calling for a split from central government</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Such agitations -- coming as they are in the midst of the <a href=\"\">country's debt crisis</a> -- threaten to undermine Rajoy's attempts to pull Spain from its financial mire.</p>\n<p>Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy told CNN that the sub sovereign debt problems are a \"hot button issue.\"</p>\n<p>For Rajoy, the push back \"accentuates [the problems], making it more likely Spain will be forced to call on the European Stability Mechanism [Europe's permanent bailout fund],\" Spiro said.</p>\n<p>But Antonio Barroso, a Europe analyst at Eurasia Group, told CNN that despite the protests the likelihood of a Catalan separation is \"extremely low.\"</p>\n<p>According to Barroso, the ruling political party in Catalonia, Convergence and Union (CiU) led by Catalan President Artur Mas, has used the eurozone debt crisis and regional elections set for November 25 to openly call for sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Barroso said: \"It is true that public support for independence has been on the rise. But the <a href=\"http://www.gencat.cat/index_eng.htm\">Catalan government</a> is implementing very tough financial adjustments and therefore the [Catalan] President, Artur Mas, is capitalizing on nationalist sentiments to shift the burden of responsibility onto the central government.\"</p>\n<p>Last week Mas met with the Rajoy in Madrid to try and negotiate a new fiscal arrangement, whereby Catalonia would manage its own taxes and transfer less money to other regions in Spain. But talks stalled.</p>\n<p>Even as Catalonia -- with its own language and culture -- strives for autonomy, in August, the CiU requested a <a href=\"\">5 billion euro ($6.3 billion) bailout from the Spanish government</a>. The request came after Rajoy announced plans for a credit line to be extended to Spain's 17 regions.</p>\n<p>But, according to Barroso, Catalonia is not Rajoy's main concern. Instead Spain's leader is focusing on regional elections in Galicia in October -- a region in North-western Spain -- where his party is likely to win and where the policies could create a model for the rest of Spain.</p>\n<p>Barroso said: \"The key area for Rajoy is Galicia because his party has an absolute majority. He wants to use Galicia as an example of how his policies are working because it is one of the healthiest region in fiscal terms.\"</p>\n<p>Spain has already requested up to a 100 billion euro ($128 billion) aid package for its ailing banks, which are still struggling to grapple with the property collapse in 2008.</p>\n<p>Pressure from European partners and investor fear over further credit downgrades for Spain could undo the calming effect of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's announcement on September 6.

But to others, his moves are far too predictable.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, Rajoy has measured his steps carefully. He has been balancing political tactics with the need to stabilize the economy. He wants to avoid the fate of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/13/business/greek-bailout-generation/index.html?hpt=hp_c1\">Greece</a>, Ireland and Portugal, which have been left at the mercy of foreign creditors.</p>\n<p><strong>Gliding sideways</strong></p>\n<p>But his steps are being read like an open book. Spaniards no longer believe he can keep up the tempo. Media speculation is centered on a European Union summit on October 18 and 19, and the potential for Rajoy to seek a bailout at that time.</p>\n<p>But this gloomy conservative has built a career on digging in his heels, and some suggest Rajoy will wait until after regional elections in the Basque country and in his home state of Galicia on October 21 before asking for any help.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's all tactics of course. By withholding unpopular news until after the election, Rajoy may have a better chance of winning a full majority in the local parliament. But playing politics with the budget may not be a good idea. Rajoy delayed announcing the 2012 budget in March until after a regional ballot in Andalucia -- the Spanish region with the highest unemployment in the country at 32.8% -- but the move did not pay off. His center-right party, Partido Popular, failed to oust the Socialists.</p>\n<p><strong>In harmony with the partner</strong></p>\n<p>Rajoy's political moves have, to a certain extent, been in harmony with the European Central Bank.</p>\n<p>The ECB this month<a href=\"http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/06/omg-omts-have-arrived-to-save-the-euro-2/\"> outlined its plan to save the euro</a> by offering to make unlimited purchases of short-term government bonds. The announcement eased pressure on Spain -- and Rajoy -- and the country's borrowing costs fell.</p>\n<p>Last week, Rajoy had yet another reason to continue his slow dance. The Spanish Treasury sold $6.3 billion of three-year and 10-year government bonds, more that it had planned.</p>\n<p>But, despite the optimism, some suggest Rajoy should request aid now, when market conditions are more favorable. Delays in acknowledging Spain needs a support package may be more costly for it in the long run.</p>\n<p>According to Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, there's a \"surreal air\" to Spanish debt auctions. Spiro, in a note, wrote the bond sales are well received because investors are pricing in an eventual request from Madrid for an ECB-backed bond-buying program.</p>\n<p><strong>Staying steady</strong></p>\n<p>Rajoy has often said he sees little point in asking for aid. This month, in his first TV interview since being elected, he said he will not accept outside conditions over a possible bailout.</p>\n<p>Speaking to Spain's national broadcaster TVE, Rajoy said: \"We have to study any conditions imposed on the bailout package and then we will see. But of course, I would not like it if they told us where we had to cut or where not.\"</p>\n<p>Spaniards taking to the streets in protest don't care about the politics as long as they can get a job, pay their mortgage and eat. Only a week ago, tens of thousands of demonstrators from across Spain took to the streets of Madrid in a large anti-austerity protest.</p>\n<p><strong>The last dance?</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the streets of Barcelona, Rajoy faces a domestic challenge that could make seeking a bailout even more complicated.</p>\n<p>Last week, Rajoy rejected Catalonia's demand for greater economic independence. As the most economically powerful region, Catalonia argues it can do without Madrid. Madrid disagrees. Fears of separatism are so acute that Spain's King Juan Carlos -- in an unusual move -- has spoken out.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.casareal.es/ES/FamiliaReal/rey/Paginas/rey_cartas_detalle.aspx?data=51\">king released an open letter on the Royal Palace</a>'s website calling for national unity and lamenting the country's economic pain. \"The worst thing we can do is to divide our forces, encourage dissension, chase illusions, deepen wounds,\" the king wrote.</p>\n<p>Many believe Rajoy will continue his slow dance despite the political discord. But it seems, no matter the delays, Spain is slowly stepping toward a bailout. As such, this could be Rajoy's last political dance.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/25/business/soares-spain-analysis/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a href=\"#cnn-disqus-area\">Comments &raquo;</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">More sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Spain: Gliding toward bailout?","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":561,"body":"With austerity measures biting hard, Greece's middle-class is slowly disappearing.","title":"Greece's 'new poor'","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":562,"body":"Earth Institute at Columbia University's Jeffrey Sachs responds to Draghi's warning to leaders at the UN.","title":"Draghi: Don't slack reforms","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":563,"body":"Italian Trade Promotion Agency President Riccardo Monti talks to CNN about the business climate in Italy.","title":"Italian official: Exports can fix crisis","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":564,"body":"If life in the eurozone's economically embattled periphery was not bad enough, now the coffee culture emblematic of southern Europe is under siege.

This is the job of the governing council. A number of things have been said and we will see what is decided.\"</p>\n<p>He added \"I would say when you embark on non-standard measures... It seems to me that it is justified... You have to counter markets that are not functioning correctly and are hampering the transmission of the monetary policy.</p>\n<p>\"It also gives time to the other partners, which are not only the governments and their policies, but also the private sector.\"</p>\n<p>The ECB is currently locked in a stalemate with the Spanish government over providing support. Draghi wants the <a href=\"\">eurozone's fourth-biggest economy</a> to formally request aid from the European Financial Stability Facility, the eurozone's temporary bailout fund, and commit to a program of structural reforms before stepping in.</p>\n<p>But last week Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and French President Francois Hollande renewed their calls for the ECB to intervene in the bond markets at a press conference in Madrid. Rajoy also stressed that Spain would consider requesting aid once the ECB provides more information on how it will fund future bailouts.</p>\n<p>Trichet added: \"The message of the central bank [ECB] is, and rightly so, 'We understand that you are doing all what is necessary to get back to a normal situation and it is on that understanding that we will do some non-standard measures.'\"</p>\n<p>Trichet says that governments in the <a href=\"\">17-nation currency bloc</a> must also support each other and do \"the job individually and collectively, surveying the other countries\" to ensure they don't deviate from their austerity programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But the former central banker is adamant that the ECB cannot neglect its primary mandate of maintaining price stability and \"the central bank cannot substitute for government macro-economic policies.\"</p>\n<p>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, Trichet said, central banks in other \"advanced economies\" -- notably Japan, the U.S. and the UK -- have embarked on \"non-standard measures\" in an attempt to tame bond markets and increase liquidity in their economies.</p>\n<p>Some German members of the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/business/2012/08/03/dos-santos-ecb-eurozone-debt.cnn?iref=allsearch\">ECB's governing council</a> are said to be opposed to the idea of intervening in the sovereign-bond markets. Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's central bank, has expressed concern that it would damage ECB credibility.</p>\n<p>Trichet said: \"It was decided at the very beginning that we will all speak with one voice... because it is a sufficient challenge to cope with 17 countries. I personally regret that we could not stick to this 'one voice' concept.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>He acknowledged that all members of the governing council were speaking with a \"sincere analysis\" of the situation and added: \"I trust that all colleagues are loyal to the institution [ECB].\"</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that several eurozone members are struggling to grapple with ballooning public debt, a <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2012/06/14/tsr-foreman-euro-crisis-us-effect.cnn?iref=allsearch\">banking crisis</a> and a lack of job creation and competitiveness, Trichet believes the euro currency has remained \"remarkably stable\" since the debt crisis came to prominence in Greece in early 2010.

But the most immediate and groundbreaking announcement came from the host country, the Cook Islands that unveiled a brand new marine park. At 386,000 square miles, it is equal in size to Egypt, is half of the nation's territory, and the largest marine park in the world.</p>\n\nThe Pacific people are counting on developed nations to come together to reverse the threats of climate change and rising seas.<br>Dr Greg Stone\n\n<p>Such a marine park is even more incredible when you consider the relative scale of the commitment; the Cook Islands have a population of only 15,000 people, but an exclusive economic zone half the size of India. Imagine any other country setting aside a full half of their sovereign territory for conservation, recovery and sustainable development. It's unprecedented.</p>\n<p>This immense ocean-to-land ratio is shared by most \"small island nations\" in the Pacific — which should more accurately be called \"large ocean states.\" This has been a stance and mentality that the leaders in the Pacific Islands have been cultivating.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, the forum leaders recognized the need to create a framework to unite their approach and their voice to manage their vital ocean resources. They unanimously agreed upon the concept of the Pacific Oceanscape, an unprecedented collaborative initiative encompassing nearly 40 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean and its islands.</p>\n<p>The<a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/global/marine/initiatives/oceanscapes/pages/pacific.aspx\"> Pacific Oceanscape</a> hosts the world's largest remaining stocks of tuna, providing approximately one third of the world's catch, and is also the region that is first to see the environmental impacts on the ocean.</p>\n<p>The Pacific people are counting on developed nations to come together to reverse the threats of climate change and rising seas, which are already impacting these low-lying islands and vibrant cultures.</p>\n<p>I have been involved in conservation in this region for more than a decade. I first visited the Phoenix Islands with an expeditionary team to survey the islands in 2000 and returned in 2002 to conduct a second survey of the islands.</p>\n<p>The condition of the reefs and the quantities of fish and invertebrates mesmerized us. The most remarkable element for me was the large numbers of sharks, indicative of a healthy reef system. The experience left me in awe -- and gave us the inspiration to work to protect such a remarkable place.</p>\n<p>In 2006, I was proud to work with the government of Kiribati to establish the Phoenix Island Protected Area. With Conservation International's support PIPA was officially declared that year, codified by parliamentary law in 2008 and inscribed as the world's largest World Heritage Site in 2009.</p>\n<p>A few years later I joined Conservation International full time and have been able to continue its near two-decade-old efforts to support societies as they move forward on this sustainable development path and to help push forward the expansion of commitments to the Pacific Oceanscape.</p>\n<p>We have been fortunate to work closely with leaders and regional institutions to develop the Pacific Oceanscape initiative and are proud to have the global marine pioneer and innovator President Anote Tong of Kiribati as a Member of Conservation International's Board. We've also acted as advisors to the development of the Cook Islands Marine Park, the influence of which will be felt far beyond the Cook Islands. The park is the largest commitment ever made to the Pacific Oceanscape and as such will be a central feature of the framework.</p>\n<p>Every year for the past three years the Pacific Islands Forum has yielded further commitments to the management and protection of the natural resources the Pacific provides.</p>\n<p>After its close, I can see that the 2012 forum has provided the most ambitious international measures for ocean conservation the world has ever seen. I hope the waves of these monumental commitments are felt around the world and inspire other nations and regions towards such great goals.

In order for this process to work, urban farmers use a variety of techniques, including hydroponics -- cultivating plants in water -- and aquaponics, which uses by-products from fish farming to assist hydroponic growth.</p>\n<p>With the world's population surpassing seven billion people and the rapid pace of urbanization, finding space to grow food is becoming an increasing challenge -- one that Edel and his team of volunteers at The Plant are rising to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2011/03/24/ef.genetic.modification.bk.c.cnn\">Watch: A farm on every roof top</a></p>\n\nAt a certain point I realized if we built an anaerobic digester, we could get our waste down to zero.\n<br>John Edel, founder, The Plant\n\n<p>In 2010 Edel began repurposing the meatpacking plant and two years on it has opened its doors to both the public, and business opportunities.</p>\n<p>Edel says of The Plant's ethos: \"It started out minimal (waste) because that's how I've always operated ... Using as little resource as possible to do things. At a certain point I realized if we built an anaerobic digester, we could get our waste down to zero.\"</p>\n<p>The Plant's anaerobic digester uses bacteria to break down organic waste into biogas -- comprised of methane and carbon dioxide -- and material that can be used as fertilizer. A \"combined heat and power system\" will convert the methane into energy, which Edel says will take The Plant completely off grid and allow it to produce large quantities of food with zero waste output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite still being under construction The Plant currently has five tenants, including aquaponic farms, a hydroponic farm, bakers, tilapia fish breeders, a mushroom garden and a kombucha tea brewer (a type of tea said to have health benefits). Their products are sold to local restaurants, cafes and markets, as well as used to produce more food within the farm itself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/30/world/europe/farm-shop-london-sustainable-agriculture/index.html\">Read more: Futuristic farm shop grows food in synthetic veg patch</a></p>\n<p>Recycling is also a big part of the inner workings of The Plant and tenants work with each other to use their waste output in their food production and farming techniques.</p>\n<p>For example, the tilapia fish produce ammonia-based waste, which is sent through a biofilter before the nitrates are fed to plants growing in hydroponic beds. The plants absorb the nitrates, cleaning the water, which is then returned to the fish in an example of a \"completed loop cycle.\"</p>\n<p>Edel says: \"The key to this farm is the closing of loops: energy loops; resource loops; money loops -- by keeping jobs local. If you can close the loops, you can make things more sustainable.\"</p>\n<p>Supported by $1.5 million in grant money from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, The Plant operates under a social-enterprise model, with a non-profit side and a for-profit side. It provides tours of the facility for interested members of the public and conduct lectures, outreach programs and demonstrations for the local community to show them how to grow food in various urban environments.</p>\n<p>Edel hopes to have the farm fully operational by 2014 and says that the facility will create 125 new local jobs.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/29/us/plant-chicago-eco-farm/index.html#disqus_thread\">0</a>\n<a href=\"#cnn-disqus-area\">Comments &raquo;</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">More sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Chicago's no waste 'vertical farm' ","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":590,"body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIDE CAPTION\n\n\nSwimming in 'synthetic soup'\nToxic diet\nTrawling for plastic\nMIcroscopic particles\nTsunami debris a new hazard\nOn the expedition\nA plastic garbage patch veteran\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;\n&lt;\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>STORY HIGHLIGHTS</strong>\n<ul>\n\n<li>A research expedition has found plastic in the last unexplored part of the ocean</li>\n<li>The crew, which includes packaging experts, is studying the effects on marine life of plastic pollution</li>\n<li>It will next attempt to measure the density and toxicity of Japanese tsunami debris</li>\n<li>Plastic in the ocean has increased 100-fold in the last 40 years, scientists estimate</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- A marine expedition of environmentalists has confirmed the bad news it feared -- the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" extends even further than previously known.</p>\n<p>Organized by two non-profit groups -- the <a href=\"http://www.algalita.org/index.php\">Algalita Marine Research Foundation </a>and the <a href=\"http://5gyres.org/\">5 Gyres Institute</a> -- the expedition is sailing from the Marshall Islands to Japan through a \"synthetic soup\" of plastic in the North Pacific Ocean on a 72-feet yacht called the Sea Dragon, provided by <a href=\"http://www.panexplore.com/\">Pangaea Exploration</a>.</p>\n<p>The area is part of one of the ocean's five tropical gyres -- regions where bodies of water converge, with currents delivering high concentrations of plastic debris. The Sea Dragon is visiting the previously unexplored western half of the North Pacific gyre -- situated below the 35th parallel, and home to a massive expanse of plastic particles known as the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" -- to look for plastic pollution and study its effect on marine life.</p>\n<p>Leading the expedition is Marcus Eriksen, a former U.S. marine and Ph.D student from University of Southern California.</p>\n\nOur nets come up with a handful of plastic fragments at a time, in every trawl we've done for the last thousand miles.<br>Marcus Eriksen, expedition leader\n\n<p>\"We've been finding lots of micro plastics, all the size of a grain of rice or a small marble,\" Eriksen said via satellite phone. \"We drag our nets and come up with a small handful, like confetti -- 10, 20, 30 fragments at a time.

According to her research, there has been a 100-fold increase in plastic garbage in the last 40 years, most of it broken down into tiny crumbs to form a concentrated soup.</p>\n<p>The particles are so small and profuse that they can't be dredged out. \"You need a net with very fine mesh and then you're catching baby fish, baby squid -- everything,\" Goldstein says. \"For every gram of plastic you're taking out, you probably take out more or less the equivalent of sea life.\"</p>\n\nWe don't necessarily want an ocean stuffed with barnacles<br>Miriam Goldstein, scientist\n\n<p>Scientists are worried that the marine organisms that adapt to the plastic could displace existing species. Goldstein said this was a major concern, as organisms that grow on hard surfaces tend to monopolize already scarce food, to the detriment of other species.</p>\n<p>\"Things that can grow on the plastic are kind of weedy and low diversity -- a parallel of the things that grow on the sides of docks,\" she says. \"We don't necessarily want an ocean stuffed with barnacles.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/world/sea-level-rise-map/index.html\">Sea-level rise: Impacts and mitigation measures around the world</a></p>\n<p>Eriksen says the mood on the Sea Dragon has been upbeat, with crew members playing a ukulele and doing yoga, \"but the sobering reality is that we're trawling through a synthetic soup.\"</p>\n<p>Also on board is Valerie Lecoeur, founder of <a href=\"http://www.zoeborganic.com/\">a company that makes eco-friendly baby and children's products</a>, including biodegradable beach toys made from corn, and Michael Brown from <a href=\"http://www.packaging2.com/overview.php\">Packaging 2.0</a>, a packaging consultancy.</p>\n<p>Eriksen says they have been discussing the concept of \"extended producer responsibility\".</p>\n<p>\"As the manufacturer of any good in the world today, you really can't make your product without a plan for its entire use, because you could eventually have 7 billion customers buy your product,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"If one little button has no plan, the world now has a mountain of buttons to deal with.

I am not always reachable. I don't always answer my phone. Sometimes, I don't check email all day. And I get a lot more done because of it. </p> Knock, Knock…and Knock <p>One day I was in my office having a meeting on an important topic. Meanwhile, a colleague emailed me. Then he texted. Then he rang my desk phone, followed immediately by my cellphone. (I am not making this up.) And finally, he came downstairs and <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/02/how-to-prevent-others-from-interrupting-your-productivity/\">knocked on my door</a>. At this point, I figured that something critical was going on, so I stepped out of the meeting to see what was so important.</p> <p>It turns out he was simply looking for a reference document that he had misplaced. It was not urgent. Yet, this individual did not see the issue in repeatedly pinging and interrupting me. In fact, he was frustrated that he could not immediately reach me.</p> Limiting the Interruptions <p>I am a big believer that our communication tools are there for our benefit. Not for the benefit of others to constantly interrupt our lives. The answer to the question, \"Why didn't you answer your phone?\" is, \"Because I was busy.\"</p> <p>When I am working on something important, I tend to shut out all outside interruptions. I go to my unreachable island of isolation so that I can get work done.</p> <p>Here are some of my favorite tactics to limit interruptions:</p> <ul> <li>Don't Answer That Phone: If I don't know who is calling, I don't answer it. Plain and simple. That is what voicemail is for.</li> <li>Use Privacy Mode to Limit Callers: I take control of who can ring my cellphone by using <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/06/6-new-productivity-features-coming-in-ios-6/\">Privacy Mode</a>. That way only the people who I allow can actually ring my phone.</li> <li>Only Read the Important Email: I don't read email very often. When I do, I make sure that I read the important ones first. I use the new <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/06/6-new-productivity-features-coming-in-ios-6/\">VIP Inbox</a> and a great service called <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/signup/0aa66c76ee?utm_campaign=invitation&utm_medium=invitation_page&utm_source=signature\">Sanebox</a> to make sure that my most important email is what I see first.</li> <li>Don't Read Unsolicited Email: Lots of people complain about spam. I don't get much. But, the ones I do, I just don't read. Delete, delete, delete.</li> <li>Use Quick Forms of Communication: A quick IM, text, or tweet can be much more efficient in some circumstances. Sometimes it is not necessary to get on the phone or have a face-to-face chat.</li> <li>I Shut My Door: When I am working on something that needs concentration and uninterrupted creative time, I shut my door. Don't let some <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2010/12/is-an-open-door-policy-killing-your-productivity/\">misguided open-door policy</a> prevent you from getting your work done.</li> <li>Set Expectations: One of the best ways to limit interruptions is to set expectations with your team. Ensure they know the preferred methods of communications and when it is appropriate to interrupt.</li> <li>Practice the Right to Decline: Many people feel guilty if they do not answer their phone or immediately respond to an email. Give yourself permission to decline the interruptions.</li> <li> Isolate Yourself When Necessary <p>I can go to my own island to avoid interruptions. And I may be unreachable, for a time, while I am getting work done. You are welcome to join me.</p> <p>Just make sure you turn your phone ringer off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/10/how-being-unreachable-makes-me-more-productive/\">How Being Unreachable Makes Me More Productive</a> | Time Management Ninja</p>  <p><i>Craig Jarrow is the author of <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/\">Time Management Ninja</a>.

How are we so easily duped when we supposedly know better? Psychologist Dr. Douglas LaBier points to a study that posits our brains are just that lazy: </p>  <p>Basically, when presented with the option of fact-checking every statement made by a politician or newscaster, our brains just make a snap decision because it's easier. If the argument seems convincing, our brains like to believe it. Of course, we have our biases, and that plays into the problem as well. We like to be right and hear things that affirm our existing beliefs&mdash;another fun problem known as <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5571612/know-how-confirmation-bias-colors-your-decisions\">confirmation bias</a>. David McRaney, author of the book and blog You Are Not So Smart, explains:</p>  <p>So how do you make your brain actually care about taking the truth? That's not good news, either, as it involves making you brain work&mdash;something it clearly hates to do. The easiest method, however, is to <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5923556/take-other-peoples-perspective-along-with-their-advice-to-defeat-your-own-bias?tag=confirmation-bias\">consider a person's perspective</a> in addition to their opinion or advice. This way you can at least consider a bias. Additionally, it helps to hear multiple sides of the argument so you have many perspectives. Of course, if you want to fact-check any controversial statements, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5919830/how-to-determine-if-a-controversial-statement-is-scientifically-true?tag=confirmation-bias\">we've got a guide to help you out</a>. None of these options are easy, but if you want the truth you have to force your brain to work a little harder.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-resilience/201210/why-youre-likely-believe-political-lies\">Why You're Likely To Believe Political Lies!</a> | Psychology Today</p> <p><i>Title image by <a href=\"http://www.jonathankurten.com/\">Jonathan Kurten</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=105275996\">Brian A Jackson</a> (Shutterstock)</i>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Why You Believe Most Everything You Read or Watch on TV","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":128,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/adachis/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#97;&#100;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#115;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dachis\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/adachis\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/110834125851515789765?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17rlayxjqajv4.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>iOS: Tired of built-in apps like Stocks and Weather taking up space on your home screen when you've got better third-party alternatives you're using instead? The developers behind Rag3Hack figured out a way to hide them so they're not cluttering up your mobile. </p> <p>Here's how it works:</p>  <p>That's all you have to do, and the app will be gone! The downside to this non-jailbreak method is that the apps will come back after you reboot.

It's tough to find one solution that fulfills every need. The BitFenix Prodigy manages to pull it off. </p> <p>When I first built my <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5815715/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-mini-for-less-than-600\">hack mini</a>, I stuck it in a diminutive Mini ITX case. The case came with an integrated power supply which died about a month ago and I had to quickly find a replacement. Fortunately, the BitFenix Prodigy recently came to market and I was pretty impressed by the specifications. Not only is the case beautiful, but it offers a ton of space and features that you normally wouldn't find in a Mini ITX form-factor. It offers room for five hard drives, an optical drive, a large graphics card, two PCI slots, and frontside USB 3.0. While it's a bit larger than your average Mini ITX case&mdash;you won't fit it in a slim media cabinet&mdash;it's still rather compact. The case sounded perfect so I called around until I found one about an hour drive away and immediately hopped in the car to get it.</p> <p>I spent the rest of my afternoon transferring my hack mini into the BitFenix Prodigy. While the case wasn't quite as intuitive as I'd hoped, I only needed to consult the manual once to figure out how to safely remove the front panel to install the optical drive. Everything else was incredibly straightforward, and I was able to add a spare hard drive and a better optical drive now that I had the extra space. The interior made this all very easy because of how it's organized, and because of a number of special compartments I had no trouble managing cables. If you don't need a tiny form-factor, this is the case you should get for your next Mini-ITX build. It's fantastic, comes in both black and white, and is well worth the $80.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ncix.com/products/?sku=71144&vpn=BFC-PRO-300-WWXKW-RP&manufacture=BitFenix\">BitFenix Prodigy</a> ($80) | NCIX</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"The BitFenix Prodigy Mini-ITX Computer Case Is the Perfect Compromise Between Design, Features, and Size","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":132,"body":"Dear Lifehacker,<br> There are a lot of people <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5952563/why-the-violentacrez-story-isnt-about-free-speech\">talking about freedom of speech on the internet</a> these days.

SafeGmail is a Chrome extension that adds PGP-like encryption to you emails, and requires a simple answer to a question to unlock. </p> <p>Once SafeGmail is installed, you simply need to click the \"Encrypt\" button in Gmail to enable it. Then, you write a question to your recipient only they'll know the answer to, write the answer, and send off your message. After waiting for a little while, you message is encrypted and a link is sent to your recipient. While SafeGmail does do server-side encryption, the service claims it never actually has access to your messages. If you'd like to peek into how the extension works and check to make sure it doesn't access anything you don't want it to, you can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/crised/SafeGmail\">open source code over on GitHub</a>. Otherwise, it's an incredibly easy-to-use encryption that both you and the recipient don't have to worry over.</p> <p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/safegmail/lmjkmpdndmbieflefonjgnnfimmkbedf\">SafeGmail</a> | Chrome Web Store via <a href=\"http://www.addictivetips.com/web/compose-encrypted-emails-from-within-gmail-with-safegmail-for-chrome\">Addictive Tips</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"SafeGmail Is a Simple Way to Encrypt Messages in Gmail","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":134,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/kingthor01/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#116;&#104;&#111;&#114;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thorink\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/kingthor\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112130794860820234172?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fivuhe4r5yb.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It's easy to get caught up in all the features of software, and then get lost in the all the various things you can do with it. However, over at Minimal Mac, they suggest it might be best to change your mindset and work with the least amount of tech possible to get things done. </p> <p>The idea here is to essentially make the most of what you have, and utilize it in a way where you're working without extraneous junk clogging up your workflow. Minimal Mac suggests you completely recalibrate your outlook with a few questions:</p>  <p>Essentially, it's about working with the exact amount of tools you need&mdash;no more and no less.

With a few simple tricks and minor adjustments to the way you operate your appliances, you can drive your energy costs down. </p> <p>I moved into a new, larger apartment this year, during the hottest and longest summer I've spent in Los Angeles. The heat was unyielding, and so was the air conditioning. When my first electric bill came, it soared to heights I didn't even expect. When I looked at common solutions, everything cost money. Solar panels cost a pretty penny and <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5917802/belkin-conserve-insight-energy+use-monitor-keeps-tabs-on-any-power-outlet\">energy-conserving outlets</a> aren't cheap either. While I could <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5823225/how-i-cut-my-energy-bill-by-a-third-with-tech-and-common-sense\">measure my energy costs</a>, I'd need to spend a lot of time and money I don't have. I'd also have to significantly reduce the way I used my air conditioning, computers, and appliances. Nothing seemed ideal, so I decided to find out if I could lower my bill simply by using everything more efficiently. I found out that I could, and you can too.</p>  Air Conditioning and Heat <p>I live with sunny weather all year round, so air conditioning usage accounts for most of my bill. If you live in a colder part of the country, however, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948075/how-much-energy-a-smartphone-uses-in-a-year-and-what-it-means-for-your-budget\">heat is probably what costs you the most</a>. Either way, you can use the thermostat more efficiently with simple tricks.</p> <b>Keep Your Vents Open and Clean</b> <p>When an inspector came to my apartment to assess various things, I asked him to take a look at my air conditioning and tell me all the dumb mistakes I was making. I found out I'm pretty stupid, and many others are, too. Here's what I learned.</p> <p>If you have central air conditioning and/or heat, check the vents in your home. Some may be closed. It never occurred to me that any vent would be closed because I would never close them. I just assumed they were open. In reality, nearly every vent in my home was closed. After opening them all up, the air conditioner no longer struggled to keep the apartment cool or kept running after reaching its target temperature. Some believe that closing vents can reduce energy consumption by preventing the need to cool or heat a particular room. That's actually a myth: closing vents will actually raise your energy costs.</p> <p>Your vents also use air filters to keep dirt, dust, and other unwanted crap from blowing throughout your home. Those filters should be replaced monthly or they'll prevent ideal airflow. You can pick up a bulk pack at your local hardware store for $1-2 per filter. Just be sure to measure the size of your vents before you go so you get the right ones.</p> <p>If you know a thing or two about air conditioning and heating, these two tips probably seem a little obvious. For those of us who rarely think about it, they're a vital bit of education we somehow missed during our transition into adulthood.</p>  <b>Promote Better Airflow in Your Home</b> <p>Trapping the right temperature in your home often requires little more than good airflow. Unless you have a very small living space, even central air and heat can have a tough time keeping each room at the same, steady temperature. If you remember that heat rises, you already know how to fix this problem. When it's hot, the heat will escape through the higher parts of your home (whether that means the ceiling or another floor). You want to help it out faster by pushing the air upwards. When it's cold, you don't want that heat to escape so you need to push it back down. Fans make both tasks easily achievable.</p> <p>Chances are you have a few standing fans in your home that require far less power than your air conditioning or heating system. Fans don't cool or heat the air, but they do move it around. When air in your home circulates properly, it's easier to maintain an even temperature and that means less work for your heating/cooling system. Position the fans so they move the air in the direction you want it to go. Simply moving the air all around your home (circulating it) will do the trick, but if you want to trap hot air you should push it down and push it up if you want to remove it.</p> <p>If you're lucky enough to have a ceiling fan, running it in the correct direction makes this easy. When it's hot, the fan should <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/397054/run-ceiling-fans-counter+clockwise-for-summer-savings\">spin counter-clockwise</a> to push the hot air up and out. When the weather turns cold, instead <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948091/trap-heat-in-your-house-by-slowly-running-your-ceiling-fans-clockwise\">spin the fans clockwise</a> to trap heat inside. You'll often find a switch on your ceiling fan to choose a direction, so consult your fan's manual to find out where it is.</p>  Laundry Machines <p>Cutting costs on laundry takes very little effort. Simply stop using heat whenever possible, pack the right amount of clothing into the machines, and tackle the task at night.</p> <b>Reduce Heat</b> <p>According to LG Electronics, who makes washers and driers (among other things), \"heating the water in the wash drum accounts for about 90% of the energy your machine uses.\" While most of us know that washing our clothing on the cold water setting will reduce energy costs, the amount was higher than I expected. I've always washed my clothing on cold out of pure laziness&mdash;because cold water won't cause colors to run quite so easily and that means you don't have to separate lights and darks. On top of saving energy, using a cold wash reduces the amount of work you have to do.</p> <p>If you're drying your clothes in a machine drier, you're obviously using quite a bit of heat. Unfortunately, there is no way around this unless you want to air dry your clothing. That's a bit of an inconvenience for some (and may not be possible for those of us in small spaces), making this method far from perfect.</p>  <b>Measure Your Laundry Loads</b> <p>Ideally, a load of laundry should pack in as many articles of clothing as possible, but stuffing your washer until it's full isn't a good idea. While the washer can likely fit whatever you throw at it, if you're using a machine drier afterwards you need to consider what it can handle as well. If there's little room for movement in the drier, the hot air won't be able to do its job and you may have to run the drier twice. That's really inefficient, so make sure your load of laundry doesn't take up too much room in the drier  you wash it. A good rule of thumb is to leave about 25% of the drier unfilled so there's room for movement, and even more if you're drying large bed sheets or blankets. Many driers are larger than washers, and your clothing takes up less space when wet, so your clothing will always fit. Measure for 25%  you wash to ensure you leave enough room for good air flow.</p>  <b>Do Your Laundry After 8:00 PM</b> <p>According to Andrew Schrage (co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.moneycrashers.com\">Money Crashers Personal Finance</a>), some power companies offer discounted rates during non-peak hours:</p>  <p>Call your power company and ask them if they offer non-peak discounts and when they begin and end. Commonly, the hours begin at 8:00 PM. I typically do my laundry and dishes in the evening, anyhow, so I see this as a great deal. Those who handle their chores during the day, however, may find this method inconvenient.</p>  Dishwashers <p>Reducing energy consumption with your dishwasher utilizes the same tactics as your laundry machines. Primarily, that means you need to reduce the amount of heat you use and load the machine as efficiently as possible.</p> <b>Reduce Heat</b> <p>Dishwashers require some heat to do a good job. Part of the cleaning process requires quite a bit of hot water. That said, drying your dishes doesn't. Most machines employ a heated dry method that you can disable. Heated drying helps prevent water spots on your dishes, but so do rinsing agents like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Finish-Jet-Dry-Rinse-Original-Liquid/dp/B004OB3FP8?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Jet Dry</a>. If you already use a rinsing agent, you can forego the heated dry method. This is because rinsing agents coat your dishes and make it difficult for water to stick to them for a limited time. Your dishwasher releases the agent later in the cycle so it can clean effectively first, too, so you don't have to worry about water being repelled at the wrong time. If you've never used a rinsing agent before, it's very easy. You simply look for a small, often circular cap on your dishwasher's door, unscrew it, and load it up with your rinsing agent until full. Then just stop the dishwasher once it enters the heated dry stage and let everything dry on its own.</p>  <b>Load Your Dishwasher Efficiently</b> <p>While you can just stuff clothing in a laundry machine and call it a day, dishwashers require a little more care and effort to load efficiently. How you pre-wash your dishes matters, and the design of each rack offers specific advantages.</p> <p>When pre-washing your dishes in the sink, your goal isn't to remove all signs of food. If it were, you wouldn't need a dishwasher in the first place. You need to worry about pieces of food, and simply leave any food residue for the machine. If you like to be extra clean and thorough, you may want to wash more. Remember that pre-washing dishes requires water, and if you're constantly running water for a longer period you're likely wasting it.</p> <p>Where you places your dishes matters. The bottom rack works best for plates, and plates should face into the center of the dishwasher. Utensils obviously go in the dedicated carriage on the bottom rack, but how you place them might seem counterintuitive. Place all utensils with the handle at the bottom. This means the sharp end goes up, so be very careful that you don't hurt yourself. The handle doesn't get as dirty, so it doesn't need as much attention as the other end of your utensils. Facing the sharp ends upwards allows more water to reach them.</p> <p>Place your bowls and cups on the top row. Cups should face down and bowls at a slanted downward angle. If you don't face rounded items downward, water will get caught inside them and may not reach the lower dishes as much as it needs to. A similar effect occurs when you place bowls and cups on the lower rack, as they'll catch water when facing upwards and block water from the top rack when facing downwards. Always load them up top. Additionally, tupperware and other thin plastics belong up top as well, regardless of their shape. The heat from the washing machine can warp them, and that's less likely to happen on the top rack.</p> <p>When dealing with large and flat objects (e.g. a cutting board), do not place them close and parallel to the dishwasher door. When loaded up front like this, flat objects can prevent the detergent door from fully opening and the detergent from being used at all. This prevents the dishwasher from properly cleaning your dishes and you'll have to run the load again. That's twice the power consumption.</p> <p>Finally, use a good detergent. You might not think this matters much, but some detergents actually do a better job of getting stubborn food off of your dishes. I've tested  and, in my personal experience, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Finish-Quantum-Base-45-Count/dp/B004S0BV06?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Quantum Finish</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Miele-CareCollection-UltraWhite-multi-purpose-powder/dp/B005MQWC0I?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Miele</a> are most effective (though Quantum Finish almost always costs less). Both clean aggressively without the harsh effects (and ultimately damage) caused by some soaps.</p>  Other Appliances and Electronics <p>We recently learned that <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948075/how-much-energy-a-smartphone-uses-in-a-year-and-what-it-means-for-your-budget\">most appliances and electronics don't have a very high energy cost</a>&mdash;they only account for about 17% of energy use in the average American household. That said,  devices have a more significant impact than others. Here's what you want to watch out for:</p> <ul> <li>Modern video game systems (e.g. Xbox 360, PS3)</li> <li>Electric kettles</li> <li>Always-on desktop computers</li> <li>Television sets (especially plasma-based displays)</li> </ul> <p>With the exception of electric kettles, which are easily replaced by boiling water on the stove, reducing energy consumption with electronics requires actually turning them off. When you have tons of devices and appliances, shutting them off regularly gets annoying. The easiest solution? Stick everything you can on a power strip and turn off the power strip. Chances are you have a few of those around the house already so you won't need to buy them. In the case of computers, even letting them sleep can draw a decent amount of power, so you should shut them off completely. To avoid the nuisance of turning them on and off, simply <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5831504/how-can-i-start-and-shut-down-my-computer-automatically-every-morning\">schedule your startup and shutdown times</a> so the computer handles the task automatically.</p>  <p>You can't do much else to reduce the energy costs of your electronics without investing a little money, but since they only account for an average of 17% of your energy costs that's not a big deal.

When you sign up, you get an app for your smartphone and a membership card that works like a debit card. When you want to see a movie, just check in at the theater on your phone, then swipe your membership card like any other debit card&mdash;it'll work at any theater that takes Discover cards, and you can see up to one movie a day. If you're a particularly big movie buff, that means you could save quite a bit of money (though it doesn't work for 3D or IMAX movies).</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are a few caveats: MoviePass is an annual membership, meaning you sign up for an entire year and are billed monthly. If you cancel more than 30 days after you've started your membership, you're charged a $20 termination fee, plus you'll have to pay for any tickets you used up until that point if they cost more than what you've paid for MoviePass. Be sure to read the FAQ and terms before you sign up to make sure the service is right for you. It boils down to this: if you know you see enough movies to make up the cost, it's a fantastic service, but if you aren't sure, don't sign up before you're ready or you might end up paying too much.</p> <p>MoviePass is currently in invite-only beta, but we got our hands on 2,000 invites for Lifehacker readers.

(How many hours did you sleep last night?)</li> <li>A clear head. (How fast did you reach for your phone to check email, texts, social networks?)</li> <li>A decent breakfast. (The number of people who don't eat within the first hour of waking up is staggering.)</li> <li>A clear set of operating instructions. (Do you have any kind of template for how you'll arrange your months, weeks, days?)</li> </ul> <p>Shortly after you wake up from a few hours of sleep (because you were catching up on blog reading and social networks and didn't realize the time), you grab your phone and read an email from an angry boss/customer/loved one. You have to rush to get dressed and out the door (we'll presume you showered), so you grab coffee and a croissant at the drive-through (if you work from home, who knows what you get).

All you have to do is select how much time you have, and Sworkit automatically generates a circuit training workout for you. The update makes that process even better by giving you a breakdown of your daily totals, showing you an approximation of how many calories you've burned, and offering videos in case you don't know how to perform a particular exercise. If we had one complaint with the previous version, it was that it wasn't the best looking app in the world, but this update also completely overhauls the design with bigger icons and a smoother layout.</p> <p><a href=\"http://sworkit.com/\">Sworkit</a> (Free)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Sworkit Adds Daily Totals, Calories Burned, and Gets a Brand New Design","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":140,"body":"  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5953703/how-to-be-sociable-when-you-dont-feel-like-it\">  </a>  Whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, we all have those days where we don't want to be sociable, but we're thrown into a social situation.

It's a lot of work, but it's definitely doable. </p> <p>DIY-Create notes that he's a big Top Gear fan, so it made sense to him to try and use car sets in his office. They may not be prized for ergonomics or features like <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5941523/five-best-office-chairs\">our favorite office chairs</a>, but they're definitely cheaper and comfortable. You'll definitely need some equipment and parts for this, and the total list came up to around $300, not including any tools DIY-Create already had in his workshop.</p> <p>Even he admits that this project was challenging and definitely not worth the effort for most people, but he also says he learned a lot, so if you're interested in an ambitious DIY project that can yield some good-looking and useful results, this might be one to try.

Well, one study from Lancaster University and published in the journal  shows that sleeping on it really does help us tackle tough problems. </p> <p>It may seem like common sense, but if you're struggling with a major decision or life change to ponder, trying to power through it and make it on the fly may not serve you as well as getting a good night's sleep and approaching the problem freshly the next day after a little rest. Here's what the researchers found:</p>  <p>Essentially, when presented with difficult problems, people who tried to solve them immediately and those without rest fared worse than the people who had the opportunity to sleep on their answers and approach the problem again after sleeping. The researchers qualify the conclusion with the fact that this only worked for difficult problems&mdash;when it came to easy choices, sleep wasn't terribly beneficial (which makes sense&mdash;when's the last time you felt the need to sleep on it when faced with an easy problem to solve?)</p> <p>So the next time you have a big choice to make, give yourself a day to sleep on it.

This makes it easy to hold the apple safely to use the peeler on it, and lets you slide off flat, straight sections of peel that you can save for mulling spices,fruit jelly, or even <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/got-apple-peels-make-tea-178876\">apple tea</a>. You also end up with an easy-to-handle apple left behind that's simple to core or chop into chunks for baking or cooking.</p> <p>Of course, if you're just going to eat the apple raw, this is a lot of work just to get the peel off (and who wants to lose the top and bottom?) but we can see it being useful if you're going to dice, slice, or chop up the apple for cooking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.food52.com/blog/4665_the_best_way_to_peel_an_apple\">The Best Way to Peel an Apple</a> | Food52</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"The Best Way to Peel an Apple for Cooking or Baking","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":144,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/phoenix/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#97;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/halophoenix\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104215081746139431649?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fjgz7r0ix27.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> Google Now is great, but it's not the only way to get useful information from Google on your smartphone.

We didn't expect you to weigh in so heavily with communications companies though, most of which have virtual monopolies, so they get away with whatever they choose. After we collected your nominations, we looked at the five worst companies for customer service, and put them to an overall vote. Now we're back to crown the worst of the worst. </p> <p> Voting was tight all weekend, and many of you straight out noted that deciding which company has the worst customer service was more difficult than choosing the best of any category. In the end however it was <strong><a href=\"http://www.comcast.com/\">Comcast</a></strong> that took the top spot with over 32% of the votes cast.</p> <p>Behind Comcast in second place was <strong><a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/\">PayPal</a></strong>, taking the silver with over 22% of the overall vote. <strong><a href=\"http://www.att.com/\">AT&T</a></strong> made a respectable showing in third place, pulling in over 20% of the votes cast. The real fight was for fourth and fifth place, which was decided by just over 100 votes: <strong><a href=\"http://www.timewarnercable.com/\">Time Warner Cable</a></strong> edged out <strong><a href=\"http://www.verizon.com/\">Verizon</a></strong> for fourth place with the former earning close to 13% of the overall vote, and the latter pulling in closer to 12%.</p> <p><i>The Hive Five is based on reader nominations.

You're familiar with the procrastinator's routine&mdash;the sinking feeling that grows stronger as a deadline gets closer, the guilt you can't shake and, finally, the full-on panic that takes hold and energizes you enough to get everything done just in the nick of time. It's that last stage we're going to talk about today. You can stop fighting procrastination and make it work for you instead by taking that panic and channeling it into amazing amounts of productivity. </p> <p><b>A word of warning</b>: these tips are going to be most useful for people who procrastinate but manage to make most of their deadlines. If you're someone who procrastinates to the point of missing deadlines on a regular basis, I'm not sure what can be done for you. Maybe Adderall.</p> Assign the deadlines yourself <p>I'm not talking about putting something in iCal, I'm talking about telling other people&mdash;your boss or your clients, people who will hold you accountable. Sometimes you'll be assigned a project with no end-date, and it will hang over your head forever. You know it needs to get done, but because there's no deadline you never prioritize it and you end up feeling guiltier and guiltier. You can fix this. When someone suggests a project or needs something finished, tell them you'll have it to them by such-and-such date. Pick a date that's achievable, but not too far in the future. Put it in writing so you know you're really committed. You'll stress about it, but because you have a deadline you know it will actually get done, rather than occupying a permanent, guilt-inducing place on your to-do list.</p> Overschedule <p>You know how they say that if you want something done, give it to the busiest person in the office? It's true. So, you need to turn yourself into the busiest person. Say yes to more tasks than you feel comfortable taking on. Are you freaking out about how you'll get it all finished? Good – it's that feeling that will kick-start productivity. Let that panic-induced energy go to work. In the end you'll be surprised at how you finished everything and then you can go and take a nap.</p> Leave things until the last possible minute <p>If you're a practiced procrastinator, thinking about the stuff you should be doing is taking up a lot of time and brain space. If you can face it, just plan on doing the project in the minimum amount of time necessary to get it finished. You know that when push comes to shove, you can write a report in four hours, say. So schedule \"report writing\" on your calendar for four hours before the report is due. Then do other stuff. You'll have cleared that brain space to think about other work, and you'll meet your deadline. Sometimes this has the added benefit of making you so nervous about not getting it finished in time, you actually start working on it ahead of schedule. Mission accomplished!</p> Do the thing that's due last FIRST <p>Let's say you've got four projects on the go, all with clearly defined deadlines. What do you mean your deadlines aren't clearly defined?! Back up to point number one with you! One of these things is due in four weeks, one in three, one in two and one next week. Work backwards&mdash;start on the last project and knock it out. Then tackle the project due in three weeks. Keep this up until it's really crunch time for the first project&mdash;the one due next week. Then, let your fear energize you into finishing it. Now you've done four weeks' worth of work in one week and met all your deadlines. Congratulations&mdash;you can take three weeks off.</p> <p>Need more encouragement?</p> <p>Here's an example&mdash;this article isn't due at any particular time. I've got another article due in three days. I'm writing this one first. The consequences of missing my deadline for the three-day article (a reprimand from my editor, possible cancellation of the piece) are bad enough that I'll force myself to finish it on time. And I'll have written two pieces in the time allotted for one. Productive, no?</p> Procrastinate usefully <p>On your to-do list there are probably one or two items that you enjoy doing more than others, but which aren't urgent. Maybe they're things like re-organizing your desk, or ordering office supplies, or making your email signature look more professional by deleting that quotation about \"seizing the day\" at the bottom. Go ahead&mdash;do them! If you can channel time you'd otherwise be spending surfing the net and biting your nails about the presentation you have to make on Thursday into something that actually needs to get done, you've just made that procrastination productive. Then, when the presentation is terrifyingly close, let your fear of not being prepared carry you right through completing it.</p>  <p><i><a href=\"http://www.nellmcshanewulfhart.com/\">Nell McShane Wulfhart</a> is a freelance writer currently based in Seoul.

Even so, refreshing and responding to posts on job boards is less effective than ever. So what do you do? Hannah Morgan at <a href=\"http://careersherpa.net/\">Career Sherpa</a> has a suggestion: stop spending so much time on job boards and use that time to find interesting companies, introduce yourself and network with people inside those companies, and apply directly. </p> <p>Big job sites definitely have a place, and we're a bit more optimistic about your chances with them than Hannah is, but she notes that major job sites are really only good for finding out what skills are in demand in your field, see what job titles people are using in your field, and which recruiters, hiring firms, and industries are doing the most hiring so you can bypass the boards and go after them directly. In the end, she argues, your chances of actually landing a job are much higher when you network and make personal connections&mdash;even if you spend the same amount of time on two or three introductions and phone calls that you could have spent applying for dozens of openings on major sites.</p> <p>If you're not convinced, hit the link below&mdash;she explains why major job sites are generally a recipe for disappointment (namely, you're competing with hundreds of people for a job that may have only been posted because of company policy, and the hiring manager either already knows someone, has a referral, or fills the position internally.)</p> <p>We've discussed <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5950403/what-you-know-now-beats-who-you-know\">whether what you know or who you know</a> is more important (spoiler: it's both,) but this approach is likely to get you into the companies where you really want to work, as opposed to just getting a form-rejection in your inbox.</p> <p><a href=\"http://careersherpa.net/stop-chasing-jobs/\">Stop Chasing Jobs</a> | Career Sherpa</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Stop Chasing Jobs, Start Chasing Companies and Contacts","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":17411,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/Gyroscope352/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#119;&#104;&#105;&#116;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/whitsongordon\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/WhitsonGordon\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115788203615961124571?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fj1m9cb4rll.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Skype updates with more support for Facebook and the addition of Windows Messenger, FedEx joins forces with eBay for faster and cheaper shipping, a mathematician uncovers a new phishing technique, and Final Cut Pro X updates. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://blogs.skype.com/garage/2012/10/skype_60_for_mac_and_windows_d.html\">Skype 6.0 for Mac and Windows Desktop</a> <i>Skype updated its Windows and Mac clients today, bringing the ability to sign in with your Facebook or Microsoft account without having to create a Skype account first.

Here's the new stuff.</p> Browsing <p>The biggest boost to convenience with using SmartGlass is probably the keyboard. You know how every time you've got to type in a password on your Xbox and you ponder whether you'd rather climb onto your roof and jump face-first into the arborvitaes or spend the 20 minutes required to select one letter at a time? SmartGlass fixes that by popping up the native keyboard every time you come to a text entry box. From what we saw, it's pretty snappy in the Xbox's Internet Explorer, and in other places you might need to enter a username or search term.</p> <p>Browsing pages themselves is also made pretty easy. You use the tablet's surface to drag the viewing area around, and you can tap links to navigate around, and pinch and squeeze to zoom in or out. It works pretty well, but you get into some trouble on pages that have smaller links. Because Xbox IE always loads the full version of sites to display on your TV, some of the controls aren't touch-friendly, even though you're using nothing but touch. It's a compromise, but not a huge one.</p> <p></p> Music and Movies <p>Here's where SmartGlass really shines, and is probably where you'll get the most real world use out of SmartGlass. You can use SmartGlass to control your music, either your local files, or streamed songs over <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5951705/xbox-music-hands-on-the-perfect-music-serviceif-you-use-nothing-but-microsoft-stuff\">Xbox Music</a>. The controls are intuitive, and make your TV seem like a big, visual entertainment center.</p> <p>For video, you can press a \"Play on Xbox\" button, and your video will transfer from your phone or tablet to your Xbox. From there, you'll have a nicely designed control panel, and, basically, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5941067/amazons-x+ray-for-movies-knows-what-youre-watchingand-whos-in-it\">Amazon's X-Ray for movies</a> feature&mdash;only much better designed. Microsoft says it will be on 65 percent of all \"views\", which is a sketchy metric, but chances are it'll be on any popular movie you watch. The Play on Xbox button changes into a play on tablet function when the movie is playing on your TV. The time between it swapping from one source to another is pretty quick, and I didn't notice any lost time or dialogue as it was changing over. At the very least, it's a much, much, much more fluid way to control your movies than clicking the shoulder buttons on you Xbox controller.</p> <p></p> Sports <p>Sports are a natural fit for the second screen, so naturally everyone's trying it. For Microsoft, it makes sense because you can use SmartGlass to navigate through content from ESPN and the NBA, UFC, and NHL (assuming they ever start playing hockey again). That will include games through your cable provider, or ESPN over your ISP. You'll get the usual&mdash;scores, rosters, stats&mdash;and the strangely heavily featured ability to pick the winners of games (no one will use this).</p> <p>The highlights and stats packages look pretty good, for something you're throwing up on your TV. But the strength of sports on SmartGlass is also a weakness. You're much more likely to want to use your phone or tablet to look at scores while you're watching a game, especially if you're using that phone or tablet as your remote. But without access to your fantasy teams, or some of the more granular stats on dedicated sports sites, it might not be enough for the kinds of fans who already have a tablet or laptop in the hands during games.</p> Playing Games <p>Some games will have a SmartGlass Duel Mode, which turns your phone or tablet (there are apps for Android and iPhone, in addition to Windows stuff) into, basically, a <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/wiiu\">Wii U controller</a>. You can use it to select what kind of pitch you want to throw in a baseball game, for example, and then you'll play a mini game to determine how well you throw it. It's a pretty neat feature, but it's totally developer-dependent, so it's not clear how much support you'll see built in going forward for content not all gamers will see.</p> <p></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Xbox SmartGlass Hands On: Controlling Your Xbox Is Really Awesome Now","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":228,"body":"\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/twitter/\">twitter</a> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/favorite/\">favorite</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/like/\">like</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/social-networks/\">social networks</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOct 22, 2012 11:30 PM\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2F5954037%2Ftwitters-favorite-button-could-have-been-a-thanks-button\">Facebook</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2F5954037%2Ftwitters-favorite-button-could-have-been-a-thanks-button&text=Twitter%3A+Twitter%27s+Favorite+Button+Could+Have+Been+a+Thanks+Button+-+%40Gizmodo\">Twitter</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2F5954037%2Ftwitters-favorite-button-could-have-been-a-thanks-button\">LinkedIn</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2F5954037%2Ftwitters-favorite-button-could-have-been-a-thanks-button&name=Twitter%3A+Twitter%27s+Favorite+Button+Could+Have+Been+a+Thanks+Button%28via+%40Gizmodo%29&description=If+you%27re+a+Twitterer%2C+you%27re+probably+very+familiar+with+the+Favorite+button+on+tweets.+It%27s+Twitter%27s+equivalent+to+the+Facebook+%27Like%27+and+a+way+to+show+appreciation+to+a+good+tweet%2C+a+weird+tweet%2C+a+tweeted+link+or+any+tweet+without+replying+or+retweeting.\">Tumblr</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/hello2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2F5954037%2Ftwitters-favorite-button-could-have-been-a-thanks-button&amp;title=Twitter%3A+Twitter%27s+Favorite+Button+Could+Have+Been+a+Thanks+Button+-+%40Gizmodo\">Instapaper</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#\">Email this post</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTwitter&#8217;s Favorite Button Could Have Been a Thanks Button\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/caseychan/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#99;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#122;&#109;&#111;&#100;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/caseychan\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108982194666919319075?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17h19vq2jqurv.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you're a Twitterer, you're probably very familiar with the Favorite button on tweets.

NetBase, the folks behind the Mood Meter, uses a natural language processing engine to try to understand tweets through grammar, broad language and even slang. The calculations are based on tweets posted in the last 10 minutes and is updated every 10 seconds, so it's as real time as it gets.</p> <p>Right now, it looks like a lot of love for Paul Ryan, Obama having a lead over Romney and Biden dipping into the red.

It's a test program for the NFC-based payment system before it gets released to everyone else. But what is Isis, exactly, and how is it different from the dozens of other mobile payment techs?</p> Isis is an NFC-Based Payment Technology... <p>At its most basic, Isis is a method of payment, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5841865/google-wallet-the-future-of-money-is-here-sorta\">like Google Wallet</a>, that's based on <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5707321/what-is-near+field-communication\">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a>. That means you can use it in stores to pay for things just by tapping your phone against a kiosk, the way you would swipe a credit card.</p> ...that uses your SIM card for security... <p>So what's the difference from Google Wallet, then? It's the security.</p> <p>Google Wallet's security is all done on Google's end. When you pay with Google Wallet, Google itself pays the merchant, and your credit card data is processed from Google's database. (Before a recent change, the Google stored your card's data on a different chip inside of your phone.) This means, basically, that it's not much different from using one-click purchasing on Amazon, or anywhere else that has your credit card information on file on its servers.</p> <p>Isis works differently. It stores your credit card data on secure SIM card that you have to get from your carrier. The data is encrypted on the SIM card, and uses an outside service called <a href=\"http://www.gemalto.com/telecom/linqus/mfs/mobile_nfc/isis.html\">Gemalto</a> to handle the secure handshake between the merchant and your phone.</p> ...that's  for in-store payments... <p>Because the card data is on your SIM card, Isis can't integrate into other payment platforms like, say, Paypal. So using Isis will be one more service you're looped into, as opposed to something like Google Wallet that would let you use the same payment data on the web. It's a minor inconvenience, but one to pay attention to as everything becomes integrated, and the goal becomes consolidating all of the services you use.</p> ...is actually supported by most major carriers... <p>At the end of the day, carriers rule what ends up on their phones, and Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are all partners in putting Isis together. That's one reason why Sprint has been the only carrier to actively adopt Google Wallet, even though it's working on <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5917725/is-sprint-ditching-google-wallet-for-its-own-mobile-payment-system\">its own mobile wallet</a>. Verizon has famously shut out Google Wallet from its phones, and AT&T and T-Mobile haven't done it any favors either. Isis shouldn't run into those problems.</p> <p>Isis is also part of a relatively recently formed organization called the <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5933447/mobile-payments-are-about-to-become-standardized-really-good-or-really-terrible?tag=googlewallet\">Electronic Transactions Association</a>, which is a collection of everyone involved in the mobile payment food chain, from carriers to credit card companies to services like Google, PayPal and Isis.</p> ...and is probably the best chance to get NFC off the ground... <p>Mobile payments is still wide open. Square is more of a stopgap between the massive success of credit cards as a technology and whatever comes next. Google Wallet has been filibustered into irrelevance by the carriers. And <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5935887/paypal-is-testing-out-mobile-payment-at-mcdonalds-restaurants\">PayPal is off forming some bizarre partnership/phone-hat deal</a> with McDonald's. But no one's really slammed the door and combined functional tech and broad carrier adoption. Isis seems like the best chance for that.</p> ...but it's unclear when, exactly, that will be. <p>Thing is, despite being a good bet to be the one to take NFC over the top, we're still not sure when that's going to happen. Today's an important step, but there's no indication of how long it'll be before it shows up in a wider context. Isis has been around for years at this point. So while phones with NFC are becoming more common, we still might be a ways away from figuring out exactly how, exactly, we're supposed to use them.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"What Is Isis Mobile Payment?","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":245,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/marioaguilar/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#109;&#97;&#103;&#117;&#105;&#108;&#97;&#114;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#122;&#109;&#111;&#100;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/mariojoze\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113911314181927715061?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17hy3nu7g3cyr.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Amazon's terms of service grants it basically god-like authority over its domain, but we all buy in because we believe that the company will be benevolent with its power. That's not always the case. Here's the story of a user whose account was deleted and her Kindle wiped with no explanation whatsoever.</p> <p>Tech blogger Martin Bekkelund <a href=\"http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/\">reports</a> the unfortunate saga of his friend \"Linn.\" Linn claims she received an email from a character named Michael Murphy representing Executive Customer Relations for Amazon.co.uk. Murphy said Linn's account had been removed because it was related to another account, which had been deleted for abusing Amazon policies. The email ended with <a href=\"http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/\">recitation of Amazon's rights</a>:</p>  <p>Linn had no idea what Michael Murphy was talking about and responded asking for more details. Mr. Murphy's follow up was cryptic and contained nothing new.</p>  <p>So in other words, Linn's account was irrevocably gone, and there was nothing she could do to find out why. Besides essentially blocking Linn from the Amazon's huge retail marketplace forever, Amazon also revoked access to the many books she had on her Kindle. Remember, just because you've spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on ebooks for your Kindle, you don't really own any of them. Thanks Amazon's DRM, the company can take your purchases away whenever it feels like it.</p> <p>We called and emailed Amazon to find out if the story is true&mdash;and how it's even possible that an innocent user could get caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare like this without recourse. We'll update when we hear back.

That said, this provides no explanation for why her account might have been terminated, or what she can do to find out.

Early flyers used <a href=\"http://www.avglob.net/2011/04/inflight-relief-aviation-toilets/\">slop buckets</a>, and WWII pilots tossed piss-filled bottles out of unpressurized windows <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory\">(seriously)</a>.</p> <p>Now, airborne waste control technology could put the Jetsons to shame. Here's what happens when you flush at 35,000 feet up.</p> <p>An airplane's facilities work on a different principle than the conventional siphon toilet found in your home, and for a good reason. Siphon toilets rely on a water-filled bowl to help initiate the passive suction effect that drains them. However, without water in the bowl&mdash;either by design or due to a turbulence-induced slosh&mdash;there's nothing to flush. And since airline cabins are now pressurized, the old bucket-and-an-open-window technique won't work either. Instead, planes today rely on actively powered evacuation systems.</p> <p>Through the mid-1980s, airplane toilets used Anotec, the blue deodorizing liquid you see in the bottom of Port-a-Johns, to push waste from the bowl into onboard storage tanks. Electric pumps actively drove the process, circulating fresh fluid through with every flush. While certainly a step up from buckets, these systems posed some significant drawbacks. Planes, for example, had to haul hundreds of gallons of Anotec on every flight, which increased their fuel consumption and reduced the number of passengers they could carry. In addition, early Anotec formulas were formaldehyde and bleach-based, which are severe eye and skin irritants.</p> <p>Anotec's worst drawback, though, was that the systems were prone to leaking. Occassionally, these leaks would escape the hull, forming a frigid ball of shit and blue fluid on the exterior of the plane. As the aircraft dropped in altitude on its landing approach, the ball would partially thaw, break away from the craft and plummet to Earth.</p> <p>When dropped from a sufficient height, frozen human excrement can be surprisingly destructive. Between 1979 and 2003, at least 27 wads of \"blue ice\" fell from the sky in the United States alone, impacting with enough force to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2006Oct20/0,4675,AircraftToiletIce,00.html\">tear through roofs</a> and <a href=\"http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.com/2009/07/car-damage-caused-by-chunk-of-blue-ice.html\">smash cars</a>. Even though it was a longshot, the potential to crush an innocent person's skull with falling frozen feces was enough to convince the airline industry to develop a fluid-free alternative. So in 1975, inventor <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents/US3922730\">James Kemper</a> patented the terrifyingly-loud vacuum toilets we use today.</p> <p>First installed by Boeing in 1982, vacuum toilets rely on <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/airplane-toilet-tour.htm\">strong suction and slick walls</a> to pull waste away using just a fraction of a gallon of water. Pressing the flush button opens a valve in the bottom of the bowl, exposing the contents to a pneumatic vacuum. That vac sucks the load down the plane's sewer line into a 200-gallon holding tank&mdash;vapors and all. A Teflon-like non-stick coating around the inside of the bowl assists in the transfer. Then, waste remains in the tank for the duration of the flight, and it's vacuumed out by crews on the ground. An exterior latch on the holding tank ensures that pilots don't accidentally drop a load in mid-air.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the Kemper system has held on as the industry standard technology for 30 years now. The FAA still receives plenty of <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/avr/afs/fsdo/index.cfm\">poo falling from planes reports</a>, as if we were back in the blue ice days. But a majority of these complaints come in the fall, and always in the midst of bird migration season. So while the witnesses are correct&mdash;it is poo falling from the sky&mdash;it's just not the type of poo you can blame on the FAA.</p> <p>[<a href=\"http://www.avglob.net/2011/04/inflight-relief-aviation-toilets/\">AV Globe</a> - <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/question314.htm\">How Stuff Works</a> - <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/eco-tourism/questions/how-do-airplane-toilets-work\">MNN</a> - <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsid=6659\">FAA</a> - Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_toilet\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_ice_(aircraft)\">3</a> - <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents/US3995328?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q&f=false\">USPTO</a>]</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"What Happens When You Flush a Toilet on an Airplane?","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":11555,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDouglas Heaven - New Scientist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Zap-happy channel-surfers could soon control a lot more than cable TV from their remotes. <a href=\"http://www.ossmann.com/mike/\">Michael Ossmann</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"http://greatscottgadgets.com/\">Great Scott Gadgets</a>, is developing <a href=\"http://ossmann.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/introducing-hackrf.html\">HackRF</a>, a software-defined radio (SDR) that lets you switch between radio frequencies on the fly.</p> <p>Most wireless gadgets, like the 3G antenna in a phone, operate using a fixed radio frequency band. But. HackRF could potentially receive and transmit any radio frequency from 100 megahertz to 6 gigahertz - a range that includes broadcast and amateur radio, GSM, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and remote garage-door openers. Ossmann presented the device at <a href=\"http://sandiego.toorcon.org/\">ToorCon</a> in San Diego, California, last weekend.</p> <p>There are other SDRs out there, but HackRF is intended to hit the sweet spot between versatility and cost - around the size of a USB hard drive and with a $300 price tag, the device could sit squarely in the consumer electronics bracket. Ossmann suggests SDR technology will bring about a revolution in the radio communications industry similar to the one that digital audio brought to the music industry.</p> <p>For now, HackRF remains a work-in-progress and isn't yet being pitched at the mainstream market. \"HackRF is designed to meet the needs of wireless communication security professionals, researchers and hobbyists,\" says Ossmann. \"It is for hackers, in the widest sense of the term.\"</p> <p>Early applications range from identifying vulnerabilities in proprietary wireless control systems to listening in on police radio. Indeed, wireless security protocols that rely on obscure frequencies could be in danger. US military research instituation DARPA was interested enough to invest $200,000 in Ossmann's use of HackRF for research into wireless communication security.</p> <p>But since the project is open source, hackers and researchers are free to take the device where they like. Ossmann thinks people will come up with uses he hasn't yet thought of.</p>  <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/\">New Scientist reports, explores and interprets the results of human endeavour set in the context of society and culture, providing comprehensive coverage of science and technology news.</a> \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Hacking a Single Radio System to Work With Wi-Fi, 3G and Bluetooth","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":16037,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/lesliehorn/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17ick9l24om9x.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dutch designer Kiki van Eijk <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2012/10/24/sewing-box-by-kiki-van-eijk/\">created this cabinet</a> to look like an <a href=\"http://happysheba.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834251fd153ef00e5531252858833-320pi\">antique sewing box</a>.

Every email that you have to archive, delete, or report costs you seconds of your life. Every store you've ever bought something from that now thinks it can send you emails whenever is stealing your time. But there are real, important emails in your inbox that you don't want to miss. So you slog through hundreds of emails for the few that matter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/settings\">SaneBox</a> is a new and modern program for sorting your inbox. It gives you plenty of controls for controlling your email flow, but you can also take a hands-off approach and it will learn what you think is important and what you usually skip. It works with most of the major email providers, except for Hotmail. There are a slew of other nifty features, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zG5yROW3oJQ\">automatically putting attachments in your Dropbox</a> (finally!) and a daily summary of the email you didn't read. And today, a year of Sanebox's Pro (or \"Dinner\") features is only $64, which is way less than the <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/pricing\">$300 per year</a> that people and businesses pay all the time. We worked with our friends at <a href=\"https://stacksocial.com/sales/spend-less-time-in-your-inbox-with-sanebox-1-year?ccode=dealzmodosweetness1year&aid=a-a6bl7rbm&bypass=1\">StackSocial</a> to offer this deal, which is $5 less than anywhere else on the internet, and a huge discount off normal pricing.</p> <p>Lifehacker Editor <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5886581/what-we-use-adam-pashs-favorite-gear-and-productivity-tips\">Adam Pash</a> likes Sanebox&mdash;he called it a <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5886581/what-we-use-adam-pashs-favorite-gear-and-productivity-tips\">\"working version\" of Priority Inbox</a>, and was debating whether to shell out for it.

We realise quickly that now is not a good time to approach the boss or that a loved one is having a lousy day. These skills are so essential that those without them are considered disabled.</p>\n\n        <p>Yet until recently, our machines could not identify even seemingly simple emotions, like anger or frustration. The GPS device chirps happily even when the driver is ready to hurl it out of the window. The online class keeps going even when half the students are lost in confusion. The airport security system can't tell whether someone is behaving as if he were concealing something or is just anxious about flying.</p>\n\n        <p>Technology that masters these skills could also help people who struggle to read the emotions of others, like those on the autism spectrum, or provide companionship and encouragement for nursing home residents. Without a grasp of emotions, some researchers argue, computers will never reach their full potential to support people.</p>\n\n        <p>''Our digital world is for the most part devoid of rich ways of expressing our emotions,'' says Rosalind Picard, the director of the computing research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology media lab, a hub of affective computing.</p>\n\n        <p>She has been working for more than two decades to translate emotions into 1s and 0s, the language of machines. One early project, with a collaborator, Rana el Kaliouby, was to design glasses for people with Asperger's syndrome, a mild variant of autism, that warned them when they were boring someone. People with Asperger's often fixate on particular topics and find it hard to read the social cues, like yawning, fidgeting and looking away, that indicate the listener is bored.</p>\n\n        <p>The prototype included a tiny traffic light, visible only to the wearer, that flashed yellow when the conversation was starting to drag and red when facial cues suggested the listener  had completely tuned out.</p>\n\n        <p>More recently, Picard and El Kaliouby have been developing software that maps 24 points on the face to intuit an emotion. In the past, computer algorithms have had trouble distinguishing among genuine smiles, smirks and the gritted teeth that come with frustration, El Kaliouby said, because they are often fleeting and result in only very small changes to   the face.</p>\n\n        <p>To capture these subtleties, webcams needed to have high frame rates and resolutions not possible until recently. The software also requires thousands of examples of each facial expression, labelled by humans - hence the women in Cairo coding recorded expressions. ''If we don't have enough examples, across cultures and age ranges, the machine won't be able to discriminate these subtle expressions,'' El Kaliouby says.</p>\n\n        <p>Affective technology may one day  help online education programs provide better learning experiences. Now, when a student makes a mistake, a program can't tell if it's because the student is bored or befuddled. A program that distinguishes this, El Kaliouby says, could offer more challenging problems to the bored students and simpler exercises to the struggling ones.</p>\n\n        <p>El Kaliouby and Picard also are working to develop Q Sensors - bands worn on the wrist that measure emotional arousal through the skin's electrical conductance and temperature, as well as activity level. For people with autism, many of whom can't speak or can't articulate their feelings - or for anyone else - the sensors provide insights into emotional state that the users may not be able to articulate themselves.</p>\n\n        <p>''With this technology in the future, we'll be able to understand things about our loved ones that we weren't able to see before, things that calm them, things that stress them,'' Picard says, adding that it will be true even for people without communication challenges. ''I've always thought of the skin as a covering, hiding what goes on inside our body,'' she said. ''Who would have ever thought of our skin as a peephole?''</p>\n\n        <p>The robotic head built at Cambridge University is part lark, part serious. It is the brainchild of Peter Robinson, a professor of computer technology at Cambridge who one day got annoyed that his GPS device kept chirpily leading him into traffic jams.</p>\n\n        <p>What if he could design a robotic driving companion that could sense mood, he wondered, keeping drivers away from traffic jams if they were in a hurry or feeling anxious? Charles, the robotic head, is the first iteration of an effort to judge how people react to different degrees of realism in a machine.</p>\n\n        <p>Robinson is also working on a system that will be able to shut down after recognising that the driver is confused, distracted, drowsy or overly tense. But the idea of emotionally aware devices like these gives many people the creeps.</p>\n\n        <p>''We want to have some control over how we display ourselves to others,'' says Nick Bostrom, the director of the future of humanity institute at the University of Oxford. If computers could read  emotions, ''it's not obvious the world would be a better place''. Affective computing is well intentioned, but  raises questions about what society wants from technology. Do we really want our Facebook accounts or online advertisements knowing how we're feeling? That's a project the researchers at MIT are considering.</p>\n\n        <p>''There's something reductionist about the coming technology,'' says Irina Raicu, the internet ethics program manager at Santa Clara University in northern California.

We realise quickly that now is not a good time to approach the boss or that a loved one is having a lousy day. These skills are so essential that those without them are considered disabled.</p>\n\n        <p>Yet until recently, our machines could not identify even seemingly simple emotions, like anger or frustration. The GPS device chirps happily even when the driver is ready to hurl it out of the window. The online class keeps going even when half the students are lost in confusion. The airport security system can't tell whether someone is behaving as if he were concealing something or is just anxious about flying.</p>\n\n        <p>Technology that masters these skills could also help people who struggle to read the emotions of others, like those on the autism spectrum, or provide companionship and encouragement for nursing home residents. Without a grasp of emotions, some researchers argue, computers will never reach their full potential to support people.</p>\n\n        <p>''Our digital world is for the most part devoid of rich ways of expressing our emotions,'' says Rosalind Picard, the director of the computing research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology media lab, a hub of affective computing.</p>\n\n        <p>She has been working for more than two decades to translate emotions into 1s and 0s, the language of machines. One early project, with a collaborator, Rana el Kaliouby, was to design glasses for people with Asperger's syndrome, a mild variant of autism, that warned them when they were boring someone. People with Asperger's often fixate on particular topics and find it hard to read the social cues, like yawning, fidgeting and looking away, that indicate the listener is bored.</p>\n\n        <p>The prototype included a tiny traffic light, visible only to the wearer, that flashed yellow when the conversation was starting to drag and red when facial cues suggested the listener  had completely tuned out.</p>\n\n        <p>More recently, Picard and El Kaliouby have been developing software that maps 24 points on the face to intuit an emotion. In the past, computer algorithms have had trouble distinguishing among genuine smiles, smirks and the gritted teeth that come with frustration, El Kaliouby said, because they are often fleeting and result in only very small changes to   the face.</p>\n\n        <p>To capture these subtleties, webcams needed to have high frame rates and resolutions not possible until recently. The software also requires thousands of examples of each facial expression, labelled by humans - hence the women in Cairo coding recorded expressions. ''If we don't have enough examples, across cultures and age ranges, the machine won't be able to discriminate these subtle expressions,'' El Kaliouby says.</p>\n\n        <p>Affective technology may one day  help online education programs provide better learning experiences. Now, when a student makes a mistake, a program can't tell if it's because the student is bored or befuddled. A program that distinguishes this, El Kaliouby says, could offer more challenging problems to the bored students and simpler exercises to the struggling ones.</p>\n\n        <p>El Kaliouby and Picard also are working to develop Q Sensors - bands worn on the wrist that measure emotional arousal through the skin's electrical conductance and temperature, as well as activity level. For people with autism, many of whom can't speak or can't articulate their feelings - or for anyone else - the sensors provide insights into emotional state that the users may not be able to articulate themselves.</p>\n\n        <p>''With this technology in the future, we'll be able to understand things about our loved ones that we weren't able to see before, things that calm them, things that stress them,'' Picard says, adding that it will be true even for people without communication challenges. ''I've always thought of the skin as a covering, hiding what goes on inside our body,'' she said. ''Who would have ever thought of our skin as a peephole?''</p>\n\n        <p>The robotic head built at Cambridge University is part lark, part serious. It is the brainchild of Peter Robinson, a professor of computer technology at Cambridge who one day got annoyed that his GPS device kept chirpily leading him into traffic jams.</p>\n\n        <p>What if he could design a robotic driving companion that could sense mood, he wondered, keeping drivers away from traffic jams if they were in a hurry or feeling anxious? Charles, the robotic head, is the first iteration of an effort to judge how people react to different degrees of realism in a machine.</p>\n\n        <p>Robinson is also working on a system that will be able to shut down after recognising that the driver is confused, distracted, drowsy or overly tense. But the idea of emotionally aware devices like these gives many people the creeps.</p>\n\n        <p>''We want to have some control over how we display ourselves to others,'' says Nick Bostrom, the director of the future of humanity institute at the University of Oxford. If computers could read  emotions, ''it's not obvious the world would be a better place''. Affective computing is well intentioned, but  raises questions about what society wants from technology. Do we really want our Facebook accounts or online advertisements knowing how we're feeling? That's a project the researchers at MIT are considering.</p>\n\n        <p>''There's something reductionist about the coming technology,'' says Irina Raicu, the internet ethics program manager at Santa Clara University in northern California. ''It reduces what may be a complex mix of emotions to maybe one.''</p>\n\n        <p>And affective technology will always be limited by our own ability to interpret emotions, says Arvid Kappas, a professor of emotion research at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany and an editor of a coming handbook on the field. People often misinterpret and misunderstand one another, and it's not clear the computers they program will perform much better, he said.</p>\n\n        <p>''The relationship of what we show on our face and how we feel is a very loose one,'' Kappas says.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>The New York Times </strong></p>\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \r\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \r\n    \n<ul>\n\n        <li>\n            <a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a>\n        </li>\n        <li></li>\n        <li></li>\n        <li></li>\n        <li><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/unloading-while-downloading-20121024-285xy.html&media=http://images.smh.com.au/2012/10/24/3740722/art-353-sa-unloading-20121024231358575377.jpg&description=Woman on bed with laptop computer\">Pin It</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/action/emailToFriend?id=3740182\">Email article</a></li>\n    <li>\n            <a href=\"/action/printArticle?id=3740182\">Print</a>\n    </li>\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\n                \n                \n            ","title":"I know how you feel","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":18940,"body":"JAMES PACKER is pushing to alter building height limits at Barangaroo to add up to 20 storeys to his planned $1 billion hotel and casino complex and make it one of Sydney&#8217;s tallest towers.","title":"Packer's sky high plan","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":18941,"body":"<p></p>Cadel Evans has issued an impassioned plea for cycling fans in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal.<br><br>","title":"Cycling has 'moved on'","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":18942,"body":"<p></p>Interviews turn nasty - and into TV gold - as Conrad Black gets angry, while hosts give it straight back to him.<br><br>","title":"'Priggish, gullible, fool'","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":18943,"body":"<p></p>\"BJ\" Leilua did \"extraordinary hurtful thing\" when he sent photo of ex's genitals to her brother and friend, court told.<br><br>","title":"Rooster sent naked photo","shortDescription":""}]}],"title":"Technology News"},{"sheetID":95,"layout":{"rowSizes":[{"length":10,"measurementType":"Pixel"}],"colSizes":[{"length":10,"measurementType":"Pixel"},{"length":10,"measurementType":"Pixel"}],"groupContentPlaceholders":[{"id":0,"start":{"x":0,"y":0},"end":{"x":0,"y":0}},{"id":1,"start":{"x":1,"y":0},"end":{"x":0,"y":1}}]},"contentPlaceholders":[{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsContentPlaceholder","groupContentPlaceholderID":0,"placeholderDisplayIndex":0,"items":[]},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsContentPlaceholder","groupContentPlaceholderID":1,"placeholderDisplayIndex":0,"items":[{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":122,"body":"<p>Readers offer their best tips for Google Contact photos, selecting files in Windows Explorer, and making a better soap dispenser. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Every day we receive boatloads of great reader tips in our inbox, but for various reasons&mdash;maybe they're a bit too niche, maybe we couldn't find a good way to present it, or maybe we just couldn't fit it in&mdash;the tip didn't make the front page.

I am not always reachable. I don't always answer my phone. Sometimes, I don't check email all day. And I get a lot more done because of it. </p> Knock, Knock…and Knock <p>One day I was in my office having a meeting on an important topic. Meanwhile, a colleague emailed me. Then he texted. Then he rang my desk phone, followed immediately by my cellphone. (I am not making this up.) And finally, he came downstairs and <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/02/how-to-prevent-others-from-interrupting-your-productivity/\">knocked on my door</a>. At this point, I figured that something critical was going on, so I stepped out of the meeting to see what was so important.</p> <p>It turns out he was simply looking for a reference document that he had misplaced. It was not urgent. Yet, this individual did not see the issue in repeatedly pinging and interrupting me. In fact, he was frustrated that he could not immediately reach me.</p> Limiting the Interruptions <p>I am a big believer that our communication tools are there for our benefit. Not for the benefit of others to constantly interrupt our lives. The answer to the question, \"Why didn't you answer your phone?\" is, \"Because I was busy.\"</p> <p>When I am working on something important, I tend to shut out all outside interruptions. I go to my unreachable island of isolation so that I can get work done.</p> <p>Here are some of my favorite tactics to limit interruptions:</p> <ul> <li>Don't Answer That Phone: If I don't know who is calling, I don't answer it. Plain and simple. That is what voicemail is for.</li> <li>Use Privacy Mode to Limit Callers: I take control of who can ring my cellphone by using <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/06/6-new-productivity-features-coming-in-ios-6/\">Privacy Mode</a>. That way only the people who I allow can actually ring my phone.</li> <li>Only Read the Important Email: I don't read email very often. When I do, I make sure that I read the important ones first. I use the new <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/06/6-new-productivity-features-coming-in-ios-6/\">VIP Inbox</a> and a great service called <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/signup/0aa66c76ee?utm_campaign=invitation&utm_medium=invitation_page&utm_source=signature\">Sanebox</a> to make sure that my most important email is what I see first.</li> <li>Don't Read Unsolicited Email: Lots of people complain about spam. I don't get much. But, the ones I do, I just don't read. Delete, delete, delete.</li> <li>Use Quick Forms of Communication: A quick IM, text, or tweet can be much more efficient in some circumstances. Sometimes it is not necessary to get on the phone or have a face-to-face chat.</li> <li>I Shut My Door: When I am working on something that needs concentration and uninterrupted creative time, I shut my door. Don't let some <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2010/12/is-an-open-door-policy-killing-your-productivity/\">misguided open-door policy</a> prevent you from getting your work done.</li> <li>Set Expectations: One of the best ways to limit interruptions is to set expectations with your team. Ensure they know the preferred methods of communications and when it is appropriate to interrupt.</li> <li>Practice the Right to Decline: Many people feel guilty if they do not answer their phone or immediately respond to an email. Give yourself permission to decline the interruptions.</li> <li> Isolate Yourself When Necessary <p>I can go to my own island to avoid interruptions. And I may be unreachable, for a time, while I am getting work done. You are welcome to join me.</p> <p>Just make sure you turn your phone ringer off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/10/how-being-unreachable-makes-me-more-productive/\">How Being Unreachable Makes Me More Productive</a> | Time Management Ninja</p>  <p><i>Craig Jarrow is the author of <a href=\"http://timemanagementninja.com/\">Time Management Ninja</a>.

How are we so easily duped when we supposedly know better? Psychologist Dr. Douglas LaBier points to a study that posits our brains are just that lazy: </p>  <p>Basically, when presented with the option of fact-checking every statement made by a politician or newscaster, our brains just make a snap decision because it's easier. If the argument seems convincing, our brains like to believe it. Of course, we have our biases, and that plays into the problem as well. We like to be right and hear things that affirm our existing beliefs&mdash;another fun problem known as <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5571612/know-how-confirmation-bias-colors-your-decisions\">confirmation bias</a>. David McRaney, author of the book and blog You Are Not So Smart, explains:</p>  <p>So how do you make your brain actually care about taking the truth? That's not good news, either, as it involves making you brain work&mdash;something it clearly hates to do. The easiest method, however, is to <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5923556/take-other-peoples-perspective-along-with-their-advice-to-defeat-your-own-bias?tag=confirmation-bias\">consider a person's perspective</a> in addition to their opinion or advice. This way you can at least consider a bias. Additionally, it helps to hear multiple sides of the argument so you have many perspectives. Of course, if you want to fact-check any controversial statements, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5919830/how-to-determine-if-a-controversial-statement-is-scientifically-true?tag=confirmation-bias\">we've got a guide to help you out</a>. None of these options are easy, but if you want the truth you have to force your brain to work a little harder.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-resilience/201210/why-youre-likely-believe-political-lies\">Why You're Likely To Believe Political Lies!</a> | Psychology Today</p> <p><i>Title image by <a href=\"http://www.jonathankurten.com/\">Jonathan Kurten</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=105275996\">Brian A Jackson</a> (Shutterstock)</i>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Why You Believe Most Everything You Read or Watch on TV","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":128,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/adachis/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#97;&#100;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#115;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dachis\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/adachis\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/110834125851515789765?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17rlayxjqajv4.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>iOS: Tired of built-in apps like Stocks and Weather taking up space on your home screen when you've got better third-party alternatives you're using instead? The developers behind Rag3Hack figured out a way to hide them so they're not cluttering up your mobile. </p> <p>Here's how it works:</p>  <p>That's all you have to do, and the app will be gone! The downside to this non-jailbreak method is that the apps will come back after you reboot.

It's tough to find one solution that fulfills every need. The BitFenix Prodigy manages to pull it off. </p> <p>When I first built my <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5815715/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-mini-for-less-than-600\">hack mini</a>, I stuck it in a diminutive Mini ITX case. The case came with an integrated power supply which died about a month ago and I had to quickly find a replacement. Fortunately, the BitFenix Prodigy recently came to market and I was pretty impressed by the specifications. Not only is the case beautiful, but it offers a ton of space and features that you normally wouldn't find in a Mini ITX form-factor. It offers room for five hard drives, an optical drive, a large graphics card, two PCI slots, and frontside USB 3.0. While it's a bit larger than your average Mini ITX case&mdash;you won't fit it in a slim media cabinet&mdash;it's still rather compact. The case sounded perfect so I called around until I found one about an hour drive away and immediately hopped in the car to get it.</p> <p>I spent the rest of my afternoon transferring my hack mini into the BitFenix Prodigy. While the case wasn't quite as intuitive as I'd hoped, I only needed to consult the manual once to figure out how to safely remove the front panel to install the optical drive. Everything else was incredibly straightforward, and I was able to add a spare hard drive and a better optical drive now that I had the extra space. The interior made this all very easy because of how it's organized, and because of a number of special compartments I had no trouble managing cables. If you don't need a tiny form-factor, this is the case you should get for your next Mini-ITX build. It's fantastic, comes in both black and white, and is well worth the $80.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ncix.com/products/?sku=71144&vpn=BFC-PRO-300-WWXKW-RP&manufacture=BitFenix\">BitFenix Prodigy</a> ($80) | NCIX</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"The BitFenix Prodigy Mini-ITX Computer Case Is the Perfect Compromise Between Design, Features, and Size","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":132,"body":"Dear Lifehacker,<br> There are a lot of people <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5952563/why-the-violentacrez-story-isnt-about-free-speech\">talking about freedom of speech on the internet</a> these days.

SafeGmail is a Chrome extension that adds PGP-like encryption to you emails, and requires a simple answer to a question to unlock. </p> <p>Once SafeGmail is installed, you simply need to click the \"Encrypt\" button in Gmail to enable it. Then, you write a question to your recipient only they'll know the answer to, write the answer, and send off your message. After waiting for a little while, you message is encrypted and a link is sent to your recipient. While SafeGmail does do server-side encryption, the service claims it never actually has access to your messages. If you'd like to peek into how the extension works and check to make sure it doesn't access anything you don't want it to, you can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/crised/SafeGmail\">open source code over on GitHub</a>. Otherwise, it's an incredibly easy-to-use encryption that both you and the recipient don't have to worry over.</p> <p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/safegmail/lmjkmpdndmbieflefonjgnnfimmkbedf\">SafeGmail</a> | Chrome Web Store via <a href=\"http://www.addictivetips.com/web/compose-encrypted-emails-from-within-gmail-with-safegmail-for-chrome\">Addictive Tips</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"SafeGmail Is a Simple Way to Encrypt Messages in Gmail","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":134,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/kingthor01/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#116;&#104;&#111;&#114;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thorink\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/kingthor\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112130794860820234172?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fivuhe4r5yb.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It's easy to get caught up in all the features of software, and then get lost in the all the various things you can do with it. However, over at Minimal Mac, they suggest it might be best to change your mindset and work with the least amount of tech possible to get things done. </p> <p>The idea here is to essentially make the most of what you have, and utilize it in a way where you're working without extraneous junk clogging up your workflow. Minimal Mac suggests you completely recalibrate your outlook with a few questions:</p>  <p>Essentially, it's about working with the exact amount of tools you need&mdash;no more and no less.

With a few simple tricks and minor adjustments to the way you operate your appliances, you can drive your energy costs down. </p> <p>I moved into a new, larger apartment this year, during the hottest and longest summer I've spent in Los Angeles. The heat was unyielding, and so was the air conditioning. When my first electric bill came, it soared to heights I didn't even expect. When I looked at common solutions, everything cost money. Solar panels cost a pretty penny and <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5917802/belkin-conserve-insight-energy+use-monitor-keeps-tabs-on-any-power-outlet\">energy-conserving outlets</a> aren't cheap either. While I could <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5823225/how-i-cut-my-energy-bill-by-a-third-with-tech-and-common-sense\">measure my energy costs</a>, I'd need to spend a lot of time and money I don't have. I'd also have to significantly reduce the way I used my air conditioning, computers, and appliances. Nothing seemed ideal, so I decided to find out if I could lower my bill simply by using everything more efficiently. I found out that I could, and you can too.</p>  Air Conditioning and Heat <p>I live with sunny weather all year round, so air conditioning usage accounts for most of my bill. If you live in a colder part of the country, however, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948075/how-much-energy-a-smartphone-uses-in-a-year-and-what-it-means-for-your-budget\">heat is probably what costs you the most</a>. Either way, you can use the thermostat more efficiently with simple tricks.</p> <b>Keep Your Vents Open and Clean</b> <p>When an inspector came to my apartment to assess various things, I asked him to take a look at my air conditioning and tell me all the dumb mistakes I was making. I found out I'm pretty stupid, and many others are, too. Here's what I learned.</p> <p>If you have central air conditioning and/or heat, check the vents in your home. Some may be closed. It never occurred to me that any vent would be closed because I would never close them. I just assumed they were open. In reality, nearly every vent in my home was closed. After opening them all up, the air conditioner no longer struggled to keep the apartment cool or kept running after reaching its target temperature. Some believe that closing vents can reduce energy consumption by preventing the need to cool or heat a particular room. That's actually a myth: closing vents will actually raise your energy costs.</p> <p>Your vents also use air filters to keep dirt, dust, and other unwanted crap from blowing throughout your home. Those filters should be replaced monthly or they'll prevent ideal airflow. You can pick up a bulk pack at your local hardware store for $1-2 per filter. Just be sure to measure the size of your vents before you go so you get the right ones.</p> <p>If you know a thing or two about air conditioning and heating, these two tips probably seem a little obvious. For those of us who rarely think about it, they're a vital bit of education we somehow missed during our transition into adulthood.</p>  <b>Promote Better Airflow in Your Home</b> <p>Trapping the right temperature in your home often requires little more than good airflow. Unless you have a very small living space, even central air and heat can have a tough time keeping each room at the same, steady temperature. If you remember that heat rises, you already know how to fix this problem. When it's hot, the heat will escape through the higher parts of your home (whether that means the ceiling or another floor). You want to help it out faster by pushing the air upwards. When it's cold, you don't want that heat to escape so you need to push it back down. Fans make both tasks easily achievable.</p> <p>Chances are you have a few standing fans in your home that require far less power than your air conditioning or heating system. Fans don't cool or heat the air, but they do move it around. When air in your home circulates properly, it's easier to maintain an even temperature and that means less work for your heating/cooling system. Position the fans so they move the air in the direction you want it to go. Simply moving the air all around your home (circulating it) will do the trick, but if you want to trap hot air you should push it down and push it up if you want to remove it.</p> <p>If you're lucky enough to have a ceiling fan, running it in the correct direction makes this easy. When it's hot, the fan should <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/397054/run-ceiling-fans-counter+clockwise-for-summer-savings\">spin counter-clockwise</a> to push the hot air up and out. When the weather turns cold, instead <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948091/trap-heat-in-your-house-by-slowly-running-your-ceiling-fans-clockwise\">spin the fans clockwise</a> to trap heat inside. You'll often find a switch on your ceiling fan to choose a direction, so consult your fan's manual to find out where it is.</p>  Laundry Machines <p>Cutting costs on laundry takes very little effort. Simply stop using heat whenever possible, pack the right amount of clothing into the machines, and tackle the task at night.</p> <b>Reduce Heat</b> <p>According to LG Electronics, who makes washers and driers (among other things), \"heating the water in the wash drum accounts for about 90% of the energy your machine uses.\" While most of us know that washing our clothing on the cold water setting will reduce energy costs, the amount was higher than I expected. I've always washed my clothing on cold out of pure laziness&mdash;because cold water won't cause colors to run quite so easily and that means you don't have to separate lights and darks. On top of saving energy, using a cold wash reduces the amount of work you have to do.</p> <p>If you're drying your clothes in a machine drier, you're obviously using quite a bit of heat. Unfortunately, there is no way around this unless you want to air dry your clothing. That's a bit of an inconvenience for some (and may not be possible for those of us in small spaces), making this method far from perfect.</p>  <b>Measure Your Laundry Loads</b> <p>Ideally, a load of laundry should pack in as many articles of clothing as possible, but stuffing your washer until it's full isn't a good idea. While the washer can likely fit whatever you throw at it, if you're using a machine drier afterwards you need to consider what it can handle as well. If there's little room for movement in the drier, the hot air won't be able to do its job and you may have to run the drier twice. That's really inefficient, so make sure your load of laundry doesn't take up too much room in the drier  you wash it. A good rule of thumb is to leave about 25% of the drier unfilled so there's room for movement, and even more if you're drying large bed sheets or blankets. Many driers are larger than washers, and your clothing takes up less space when wet, so your clothing will always fit. Measure for 25%  you wash to ensure you leave enough room for good air flow.</p>  <b>Do Your Laundry After 8:00 PM</b> <p>According to Andrew Schrage (co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.moneycrashers.com\">Money Crashers Personal Finance</a>), some power companies offer discounted rates during non-peak hours:</p>  <p>Call your power company and ask them if they offer non-peak discounts and when they begin and end. Commonly, the hours begin at 8:00 PM. I typically do my laundry and dishes in the evening, anyhow, so I see this as a great deal. Those who handle their chores during the day, however, may find this method inconvenient.</p>  Dishwashers <p>Reducing energy consumption with your dishwasher utilizes the same tactics as your laundry machines. Primarily, that means you need to reduce the amount of heat you use and load the machine as efficiently as possible.</p> <b>Reduce Heat</b> <p>Dishwashers require some heat to do a good job. Part of the cleaning process requires quite a bit of hot water. That said, drying your dishes doesn't. Most machines employ a heated dry method that you can disable. Heated drying helps prevent water spots on your dishes, but so do rinsing agents like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Finish-Jet-Dry-Rinse-Original-Liquid/dp/B004OB3FP8?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Jet Dry</a>. If you already use a rinsing agent, you can forego the heated dry method. This is because rinsing agents coat your dishes and make it difficult for water to stick to them for a limited time. Your dishwasher releases the agent later in the cycle so it can clean effectively first, too, so you don't have to worry about water being repelled at the wrong time. If you've never used a rinsing agent before, it's very easy. You simply look for a small, often circular cap on your dishwasher's door, unscrew it, and load it up with your rinsing agent until full. Then just stop the dishwasher once it enters the heated dry stage and let everything dry on its own.</p>  <b>Load Your Dishwasher Efficiently</b> <p>While you can just stuff clothing in a laundry machine and call it a day, dishwashers require a little more care and effort to load efficiently. How you pre-wash your dishes matters, and the design of each rack offers specific advantages.</p> <p>When pre-washing your dishes in the sink, your goal isn't to remove all signs of food. If it were, you wouldn't need a dishwasher in the first place. You need to worry about pieces of food, and simply leave any food residue for the machine. If you like to be extra clean and thorough, you may want to wash more. Remember that pre-washing dishes requires water, and if you're constantly running water for a longer period you're likely wasting it.</p> <p>Where you places your dishes matters. The bottom rack works best for plates, and plates should face into the center of the dishwasher. Utensils obviously go in the dedicated carriage on the bottom rack, but how you place them might seem counterintuitive. Place all utensils with the handle at the bottom. This means the sharp end goes up, so be very careful that you don't hurt yourself. The handle doesn't get as dirty, so it doesn't need as much attention as the other end of your utensils. Facing the sharp ends upwards allows more water to reach them.</p> <p>Place your bowls and cups on the top row. Cups should face down and bowls at a slanted downward angle. If you don't face rounded items downward, water will get caught inside them and may not reach the lower dishes as much as it needs to. A similar effect occurs when you place bowls and cups on the lower rack, as they'll catch water when facing upwards and block water from the top rack when facing downwards. Always load them up top. Additionally, tupperware and other thin plastics belong up top as well, regardless of their shape. The heat from the washing machine can warp them, and that's less likely to happen on the top rack.</p> <p>When dealing with large and flat objects (e.g. a cutting board), do not place them close and parallel to the dishwasher door. When loaded up front like this, flat objects can prevent the detergent door from fully opening and the detergent from being used at all. This prevents the dishwasher from properly cleaning your dishes and you'll have to run the load again. That's twice the power consumption.</p> <p>Finally, use a good detergent. You might not think this matters much, but some detergents actually do a better job of getting stubborn food off of your dishes. I've tested  and, in my personal experience, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Finish-Quantum-Base-45-Count/dp/B004S0BV06?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Quantum Finish</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Miele-CareCollection-UltraWhite-multi-purpose-powder/dp/B005MQWC0I?tag=gmgamzn-20\">Miele</a> are most effective (though Quantum Finish almost always costs less). Both clean aggressively without the harsh effects (and ultimately damage) caused by some soaps.</p>  Other Appliances and Electronics <p>We recently learned that <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5948075/how-much-energy-a-smartphone-uses-in-a-year-and-what-it-means-for-your-budget\">most appliances and electronics don't have a very high energy cost</a>&mdash;they only account for about 17% of energy use in the average American household. That said,  devices have a more significant impact than others. Here's what you want to watch out for:</p> <ul> <li>Modern video game systems (e.g. Xbox 360, PS3)</li> <li>Electric kettles</li> <li>Always-on desktop computers</li> <li>Television sets (especially plasma-based displays)</li> </ul> <p>With the exception of electric kettles, which are easily replaced by boiling water on the stove, reducing energy consumption with electronics requires actually turning them off. When you have tons of devices and appliances, shutting them off regularly gets annoying. The easiest solution? Stick everything you can on a power strip and turn off the power strip. Chances are you have a few of those around the house already so you won't need to buy them. In the case of computers, even letting them sleep can draw a decent amount of power, so you should shut them off completely. To avoid the nuisance of turning them on and off, simply <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5831504/how-can-i-start-and-shut-down-my-computer-automatically-every-morning\">schedule your startup and shutdown times</a> so the computer handles the task automatically.</p>  <p>You can't do much else to reduce the energy costs of your electronics without investing a little money, but since they only account for an average of 17% of your energy costs that's not a big deal.

When you sign up, you get an app for your smartphone and a membership card that works like a debit card. When you want to see a movie, just check in at the theater on your phone, then swipe your membership card like any other debit card&mdash;it'll work at any theater that takes Discover cards, and you can see up to one movie a day. If you're a particularly big movie buff, that means you could save quite a bit of money (though it doesn't work for 3D or IMAX movies).</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are a few caveats: MoviePass is an annual membership, meaning you sign up for an entire year and are billed monthly. If you cancel more than 30 days after you've started your membership, you're charged a $20 termination fee, plus you'll have to pay for any tickets you used up until that point if they cost more than what you've paid for MoviePass. Be sure to read the FAQ and terms before you sign up to make sure the service is right for you. It boils down to this: if you know you see enough movies to make up the cost, it's a fantastic service, but if you aren't sure, don't sign up before you're ready or you might end up paying too much.</p> <p>MoviePass is currently in invite-only beta, but we got our hands on 2,000 invites for Lifehacker readers.

(How many hours did you sleep last night?)</li> <li>A clear head. (How fast did you reach for your phone to check email, texts, social networks?)</li> <li>A decent breakfast. (The number of people who don't eat within the first hour of waking up is staggering.)</li> <li>A clear set of operating instructions. (Do you have any kind of template for how you'll arrange your months, weeks, days?)</li> </ul> <p>Shortly after you wake up from a few hours of sleep (because you were catching up on blog reading and social networks and didn't realize the time), you grab your phone and read an email from an angry boss/customer/loved one. You have to rush to get dressed and out the door (we'll presume you showered), so you grab coffee and a croissant at the drive-through (if you work from home, who knows what you get).

All you have to do is select how much time you have, and Sworkit automatically generates a circuit training workout for you. The update makes that process even better by giving you a breakdown of your daily totals, showing you an approximation of how many calories you've burned, and offering videos in case you don't know how to perform a particular exercise. If we had one complaint with the previous version, it was that it wasn't the best looking app in the world, but this update also completely overhauls the design with bigger icons and a smoother layout.</p> <p><a href=\"http://sworkit.com/\">Sworkit</a> (Free)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Sworkit Adds Daily Totals, Calories Burned, and Gets a Brand New Design","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":140,"body":"  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5953703/how-to-be-sociable-when-you-dont-feel-like-it\">  </a>  Whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, we all have those days where we don't want to be sociable, but we're thrown into a social situation.

It's a lot of work, but it's definitely doable. </p> <p>DIY-Create notes that he's a big Top Gear fan, so it made sense to him to try and use car sets in his office. They may not be prized for ergonomics or features like <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5941523/five-best-office-chairs\">our favorite office chairs</a>, but they're definitely cheaper and comfortable. You'll definitely need some equipment and parts for this, and the total list came up to around $300, not including any tools DIY-Create already had in his workshop.</p> <p>Even he admits that this project was challenging and definitely not worth the effort for most people, but he also says he learned a lot, so if you're interested in an ambitious DIY project that can yield some good-looking and useful results, this might be one to try.

Well, one study from Lancaster University and published in the journal  shows that sleeping on it really does help us tackle tough problems. </p> <p>It may seem like common sense, but if you're struggling with a major decision or life change to ponder, trying to power through it and make it on the fly may not serve you as well as getting a good night's sleep and approaching the problem freshly the next day after a little rest. Here's what the researchers found:</p>  <p>Essentially, when presented with difficult problems, people who tried to solve them immediately and those without rest fared worse than the people who had the opportunity to sleep on their answers and approach the problem again after sleeping. The researchers qualify the conclusion with the fact that this only worked for difficult problems&mdash;when it came to easy choices, sleep wasn't terribly beneficial (which makes sense&mdash;when's the last time you felt the need to sleep on it when faced with an easy problem to solve?)</p> <p>So the next time you have a big choice to make, give yourself a day to sleep on it.

This makes it easy to hold the apple safely to use the peeler on it, and lets you slide off flat, straight sections of peel that you can save for mulling spices,fruit jelly, or even <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/got-apple-peels-make-tea-178876\">apple tea</a>. You also end up with an easy-to-handle apple left behind that's simple to core or chop into chunks for baking or cooking.</p> <p>Of course, if you're just going to eat the apple raw, this is a lot of work just to get the peel off (and who wants to lose the top and bottom?) but we can see it being useful if you're going to dice, slice, or chop up the apple for cooking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.food52.com/blog/4665_the_best_way_to_peel_an_apple\">The Best Way to Peel an Apple</a> | Food52</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"The Best Way to Peel an Apple for Cooking or Baking","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":144,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/phoenix/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#97;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/halophoenix\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104215081746139431649?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fjgz7r0ix27.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> Google Now is great, but it's not the only way to get useful information from Google on your smartphone.

We didn't expect you to weigh in so heavily with communications companies though, most of which have virtual monopolies, so they get away with whatever they choose. After we collected your nominations, we looked at the five worst companies for customer service, and put them to an overall vote. Now we're back to crown the worst of the worst. </p> <p> Voting was tight all weekend, and many of you straight out noted that deciding which company has the worst customer service was more difficult than choosing the best of any category. In the end however it was <strong><a href=\"http://www.comcast.com/\">Comcast</a></strong> that took the top spot with over 32% of the votes cast.</p> <p>Behind Comcast in second place was <strong><a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/\">PayPal</a></strong>, taking the silver with over 22% of the overall vote. <strong><a href=\"http://www.att.com/\">AT&T</a></strong> made a respectable showing in third place, pulling in over 20% of the votes cast. The real fight was for fourth and fifth place, which was decided by just over 100 votes: <strong><a href=\"http://www.timewarnercable.com/\">Time Warner Cable</a></strong> edged out <strong><a href=\"http://www.verizon.com/\">Verizon</a></strong> for fourth place with the former earning close to 13% of the overall vote, and the latter pulling in closer to 12%.</p> <p><i>The Hive Five is based on reader nominations.

You're familiar with the procrastinator's routine&mdash;the sinking feeling that grows stronger as a deadline gets closer, the guilt you can't shake and, finally, the full-on panic that takes hold and energizes you enough to get everything done just in the nick of time. It's that last stage we're going to talk about today. You can stop fighting procrastination and make it work for you instead by taking that panic and channeling it into amazing amounts of productivity. </p> <p><b>A word of warning</b>: these tips are going to be most useful for people who procrastinate but manage to make most of their deadlines. If you're someone who procrastinates to the point of missing deadlines on a regular basis, I'm not sure what can be done for you. Maybe Adderall.</p> Assign the deadlines yourself <p>I'm not talking about putting something in iCal, I'm talking about telling other people&mdash;your boss or your clients, people who will hold you accountable. Sometimes you'll be assigned a project with no end-date, and it will hang over your head forever. You know it needs to get done, but because there's no deadline you never prioritize it and you end up feeling guiltier and guiltier. You can fix this. When someone suggests a project or needs something finished, tell them you'll have it to them by such-and-such date. Pick a date that's achievable, but not too far in the future. Put it in writing so you know you're really committed. You'll stress about it, but because you have a deadline you know it will actually get done, rather than occupying a permanent, guilt-inducing place on your to-do list.</p> Overschedule <p>You know how they say that if you want something done, give it to the busiest person in the office? It's true. So, you need to turn yourself into the busiest person. Say yes to more tasks than you feel comfortable taking on. Are you freaking out about how you'll get it all finished? Good – it's that feeling that will kick-start productivity. Let that panic-induced energy go to work. In the end you'll be surprised at how you finished everything and then you can go and take a nap.</p> Leave things until the last possible minute <p>If you're a practiced procrastinator, thinking about the stuff you should be doing is taking up a lot of time and brain space. If you can face it, just plan on doing the project in the minimum amount of time necessary to get it finished. You know that when push comes to shove, you can write a report in four hours, say. So schedule \"report writing\" on your calendar for four hours before the report is due. Then do other stuff. You'll have cleared that brain space to think about other work, and you'll meet your deadline. Sometimes this has the added benefit of making you so nervous about not getting it finished in time, you actually start working on it ahead of schedule. Mission accomplished!</p> Do the thing that's due last FIRST <p>Let's say you've got four projects on the go, all with clearly defined deadlines. What do you mean your deadlines aren't clearly defined?! Back up to point number one with you! One of these things is due in four weeks, one in three, one in two and one next week. Work backwards&mdash;start on the last project and knock it out. Then tackle the project due in three weeks. Keep this up until it's really crunch time for the first project&mdash;the one due next week. Then, let your fear energize you into finishing it. Now you've done four weeks' worth of work in one week and met all your deadlines. Congratulations&mdash;you can take three weeks off.</p> <p>Need more encouragement?</p> <p>Here's an example&mdash;this article isn't due at any particular time. I've got another article due in three days. I'm writing this one first. The consequences of missing my deadline for the three-day article (a reprimand from my editor, possible cancellation of the piece) are bad enough that I'll force myself to finish it on time. And I'll have written two pieces in the time allotted for one. Productive, no?</p> Procrastinate usefully <p>On your to-do list there are probably one or two items that you enjoy doing more than others, but which aren't urgent. Maybe they're things like re-organizing your desk, or ordering office supplies, or making your email signature look more professional by deleting that quotation about \"seizing the day\" at the bottom. Go ahead&mdash;do them! If you can channel time you'd otherwise be spending surfing the net and biting your nails about the presentation you have to make on Thursday into something that actually needs to get done, you've just made that procrastination productive. Then, when the presentation is terrifyingly close, let your fear of not being prepared carry you right through completing it.</p>  <p><i><a href=\"http://www.nellmcshanewulfhart.com/\">Nell McShane Wulfhart</a> is a freelance writer currently based in Seoul.

Even so, refreshing and responding to posts on job boards is less effective than ever. So what do you do? Hannah Morgan at <a href=\"http://careersherpa.net/\">Career Sherpa</a> has a suggestion: stop spending so much time on job boards and use that time to find interesting companies, introduce yourself and network with people inside those companies, and apply directly. </p> <p>Big job sites definitely have a place, and we're a bit more optimistic about your chances with them than Hannah is, but she notes that major job sites are really only good for finding out what skills are in demand in your field, see what job titles people are using in your field, and which recruiters, hiring firms, and industries are doing the most hiring so you can bypass the boards and go after them directly. In the end, she argues, your chances of actually landing a job are much higher when you network and make personal connections&mdash;even if you spend the same amount of time on two or three introductions and phone calls that you could have spent applying for dozens of openings on major sites.</p> <p>If you're not convinced, hit the link below&mdash;she explains why major job sites are generally a recipe for disappointment (namely, you're competing with hundreds of people for a job that may have only been posted because of company policy, and the hiring manager either already knows someone, has a referral, or fills the position internally.)</p> <p>We've discussed <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5950403/what-you-know-now-beats-who-you-know\">whether what you know or who you know</a> is more important (spoiler: it's both,) but this approach is likely to get you into the companies where you really want to work, as opposed to just getting a form-rejection in your inbox.</p> <p><a href=\"http://careersherpa.net/stop-chasing-jobs/\">Stop Chasing Jobs</a> | Career Sherpa</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t","title":"Stop Chasing Jobs, Start Chasing Companies and Contacts","shortDescription":""},{"class":"newsfeeder.lib.model.NewsItem","itemID":17411,"body":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/people/Gyroscope352/\">View Profile</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"mailto:&#119;&#104;&#105;&#116;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#102;&#101;&#104;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">Email</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/whitsongordon\">Facebook</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/WhitsonGordon\">Twitter</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115788203615961124571?rel=author\">Google Plus</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"/author/17fj1m9cb4rll.xml\">RSS</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Skype updates with more support for Facebook and the addition of Windows Messenger, FedEx joins forces with eBay for faster and cheaper shipping, a mathematician uncovers a new phishing technique, and Final Cut Pro X updates. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://blogs.skype.com/garage/2012/10/skype_60_for_mac_and_windows_d.html\">Skype 6.0 for Mac and Windows Desktop</a> <i>Skype updated its Windows and Mac clients today, bringing the ability to sign in with your Facebook or Microsoft account without having to create a Skype account first.

When they extended the offer again this year, I happily accepted. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI received an email notifying me that judging begins today, so I cracked my knuckles, sat down in front of my three monitors (all the better to judge with!) and &hellip; saw that there were around <b>340 entries</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat's when I started to get a little freaked out about the math. Perhaps we can throw 5% of the entrants out as obviously incomplete or unfinished. That leaves 323 entries to judge. Personally, I'm not comfortable saying I judged a competition unless I actually <i>look</i> at each one of the entries, so at an absolute <i>minimum</i> I have to click through to each webapp. Once I do, I couldn't imagine properly evaluating the webapp without spending at least 30 seconds looking at the homepage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet's be generous and say I need 10 seconds to orient myself and account for page load times, and 30 seconds to look at each entry. That totals <b>three and a half hours</b> of my, y'know, infinitely valuable time. In which I could be finding a cure for cancer, or clicking on LOLcats. I still felt guilty about only allocating half a minute per entry; is it fair to the contestants if I make my decision based on 30 seconds of scanning their landing page and maybe a few desultory clicks?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut then I had an epiphany: <b>yes, deciding in 30 seconds <i>is</i> totally completely unfair, but that's also exactly how it works in the real world</b>. Users are going to click through to your web site, look at it for maybe 30 seconds, and either decide that it's worthy, or reach for the almighty back button on their browser and bug out. Thirty seconds might even be a bit generous. In <a href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/blink/\">one Canadian study</a>, users made up their mind about websites in <i>under a second</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe opportunity cost to switch websites is one tiny little click of the mouse or tap of the finger. What I learned from judging the Rails Rumble most of all is that <b>your website's front page needs to be kind of awesome</b>. It is never the complete story, of course, but do not squander your first opportunity to make an impression on a visitor. It may be the only one you get.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI'm not sure I was learning much about these apps while I judged, and for that I am truly sorry. But along the way I accidentally learned a heck of a lot about <b>what makes a great front page</b> for a web application. So I'd like to share that with you, and all future Rails Rumble entrants:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realize that Rails Rumble apps only have a mere 48 hours to build an entire app from scratch. I am not expecting a super professional amazing home page on every one of the entries, nor did I judge it that way. But I do know that <b>a basic sketch of a homepage design is the <i>first</i> thing you should work on in any webapp, because it serves as the essential starting design document and vision statement.</b> Unless you <i>start</i> with a basic homepage that meets the above 5 rules, your app won't survive most judges, much less the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/designing-for-informavores-or-why-users-behave-like-animals-online.html\">herds of informavores</a> running wild on the Internet. \r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] Hiring developers?

OK, Maybe Just for Fun</a> \r\n\r\nOctober 15, 2012 \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1998 I briefly worked for FiringSquad, a gaming website founded by Doom and Quake champion Thresh aka <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Fong\">Dennis Fong</a> and his brother Kyle. I can trace my long-standing interest in <a href=\"http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/aeron/default.asp\">chairs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.firingsquad.com/guides/keyboards/default.asp\">keyboards</a> to some of the early, groundbreaking articles they wrote. Dennis and Kyle were great guys to work with, and we'd occasionally chat on the phone about geeky hardware hotrodding stuff, like the one time they got so embroiled in PC build one-upmanship that they were actually building rack-mount PCs &hellip; <i>for their home</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo I suppose it is inevitable that I'd eventually get around to writing an article about <b>building rack-mount PCs</b>. But <i>not</i> the kind that go in your home. No, that'd be as nuts as the now-discontinued <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Home_Server\">Windows Home Server</a> product.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nServers belong in their native habitat, the datacenter. Which can be <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2011/04/16/photo-tour-of-facebooks-new-datacenter/\">kind of amazing places in their own right</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe above photo is from Facebook's <a href=\"http://opencompute.org/\">Open Compute Project</a>, which is about building extremely energy efficient datacenters. And that starts with <a href=\"http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/closer-look-open-compute-server-designs/\">minimalistic, no-frills 1U server designs</a>, where 1U is the smallest amount of space divisible in a server rack.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI doubt many companies are big enough to even consider building their own datacenter, but if Facebook is building their own custom servers out of commodity x86 parts, couldn't we do it too? In a world of inexpensive, rentable virtual machines, like <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine\">Google Compute Engine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/\">Azure Cloud</a>, <b>does it really make sense to build your own server and colocate it in a datacenter?</b> \r\n</p>\r\nIt's <a href=\"https://blog.cloudvertical.com/2012/10/aws-cost-cheat-sheet-2/\">kind of tough</a> to tell exactly how much an Amazon EC2 instance will cost you since it varies a lot by usage. But if I use the Amazon Web Services <a href=\"http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html\">simple monthly calculator</a> and select the Web Application \"common customer sample\", that provides a figure of <b>$1,414 per month, or $17k/year</b>. If you want to run a typical web app on EC2, that's what you should expect to pay. So let's use that as a baseline.\r\n<p>\r\nThe <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">instance types</a> included in the Web Application customer sample are <s>2</s>4 small (for the front end), and <s>1</s>2 large (for the database). Here are the current specs on the large instance:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>7.5 GB memory\r\n<li>2 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each\r\n<li>850 GB instance storage\r\n<li>64-bit platform\r\n<li>I/O Performance: High\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nYou might be wondering what the heck a <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#What_is_an_EC2_Compute_Unit_and_why_did_you_introduce_it\">EC2 Compute Unit</a> is; it's Amazon's way of normalizing CPU performance. By their <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#What_is_an_EC2_Compute_Unit_and_why_did_you_introduce_it\">definition</a>, what we get in the large instance is akin to an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon#Overview\">2008 era</a> dual core 2.4 GHz Xeon CPU. Yes, you can pay more and get <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">faster instances</a>, but switching instances from the small to the high-CPU and from the large to the high-MEM more than doubles the bill to <b>$3,302 per month or $40k/year</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAssuming you subscribe to the theory of <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/06/scaling-up-vs-scaling-out-hidden-costs.html\">scaling out versus scaling up</a>, building a bunch of decent bang-for-the-buck commodity servers is what you're supposed to be doing. I avoided directly building servers when we were scaling up Stack Overflow, electing to <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-server-glamour-shots/\">buy pre-assembled hardware from Lenovo instead</a>. But this time, I decided the state of hardware has advanced sufficiently since 2009 that I'm comfortable cutting out the middleman in 2012 and <b>building the servers myself, from scratch</b>. That's why I just built four servers exactly like this:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intel <a href=\"http://ark.intel.com/products/65725/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1280V2-8M-Cache-3_60-GHz\">Xeon E3-1280</a> V2 Ivy Bridge 3.6 Ghz / 4.0 Ghz turbo quad-core ($640)\r\n<li>SuperMicro <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004WKRDA4/?tag=codihorr-20\">X9SCM-F-O</a> ($190)\r\n<li>32 GB DDR3-1600 ($292)\r\n<li>SuperMicro <a href=\"http://www.supermicro.com/products/chassis/1U/111/SC111LT-330C.cfm\">SC111LT-330CB</a> 1U rackmount chassis ($200)\r\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0077CR6B0/?tag=codihorr-20\">Samsung 830</a> 512GB hard drives in a <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/05/beyond-raid.html\">RAID-1 mirror</a> ($540 &times; 2)\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n(If you are using this as a shopping list, you will also need 4-pin power <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812200961\">extensions</a> for the case, and the SuperMicro 1u <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816101298\">passive heatsink</a>. The killer feature of SuperMicro motherboards that makes them all server-y in the first place is the built in <a href=\"http://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-ipmiview-review-remote-server-monitoring-management-ipmi-20-kvm-over-ip/\">hardware KVM-over-IP</a>. That's right, unless the server is literally unplugged, you can remote in and install an operating system, tweak the BIOS, power it on and off, and so on. It works. I use it daily.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBased on the above specs, this server has comparable memory to the High-Memory Double Extra Large Instance, comparable CPU power to the High-CPU Extra Large Instance, and comparable disk performance to the High I/O Quadruple Extra Large Instance. This is a very, <i>very</i> high end server <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">by EC2 standards</a>. It would be prohibitively expensive to run this hardware in the Amazon cloud. But how much will it cost us to build? Just $2,452. Adding 10% for taxes, shipping, etc let's call it $2,750 per server. <b>One brand new top-of-the-line server costs about as much as two months of EC2 web application hosting.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, that figure doesn't include the cost in time to build and rack the server, the <a href=\"http://blog.pinboard.in/2012/06/going_colo/\">cost of colocating the server</a>, and the ongoing cost of managing and maintaining the server. But I humbly submit that the one-time cost of paying for three of these servers, plus the cost of colocation, plus a bunch of extra money on top to cover provisioning and maintenance and support, will still be <i>significantly</i> less than $17,000 for a <i>single year</i> of EC2 web application hosting. Every year after the first year will be gravy, until the servers are obsolete &ndash; which even conservatively has to be at least three years. Perhaps most importantly, these servers will offer <b>vastly better performance</b> than you could get from EC2 to run your web application, at least not without paying astronomical amounts of money for the privilege.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n(If you are concerned about power consumption, don't be. I just measured the power use of the server using my trusty <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/08/why-estimate-when-you-can-measure.html\">Kill-a-Watt device</a>: <b>31 watts</b> (0.28 amps) at idle, <b>87 watts</b> (0.75 amps) under never-gonna-happen artificial 100% CPU load. The three front fans in the SuperMicro case are plugged into the motherboard and only spin up at boot and under extreme load. It's shockingly quiet in typical use for a 1U server.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI realize that to some extent we're comparing apples and oranges. Either you have a perverse desire to <a href=\"http://blog.pinboard.in/2012/05/a_cloud_of_my_own/\">mess around with hardware</a>, or you're more than willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money to have someone else worry about all that stuff (and, to be fair, give you levels of flexibility, bandwidth, and availability that would be impossible to achieve even if you colocate servers at multiple facilities). $51,000 over three years is enough to pay for a <i>lot</i> of colocation and very high end hardware. But maybe the truly precious resource at your organization is people's time, not money, and that $51k is barely a rounding error in your budget.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnyway, I want to make it clear that <b>building and colocating your own servers isn't (always) crazy, it isn't scary, heck, it isn't even particularly <i>hard</i></b>. In some situations it can make sense to build and rack your own servers, provided &hellip;\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you want absolute top of the line server performance without paying thousands of dollars per month for the privilege\r\n<li>you are willing to invest the time in building, racking, and configuring your servers\r\n<li>you have the capital to invest up front\r\n<li>you desire total control over the hardware\r\n<li>you aren't worried about the flexibility of quickly provisioning new servers to handle unanticipated load\r\n<li>you don't need the redundancy, geographical backup, and flexibility that comes with cloud virtualization\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy do I choose to build and colocate servers? Primarily to achieve maximum performance. That's the one thing you consistently just <i>do not get</i> from cloud hosting solutions unless you are willing to pay a massive premium, per month, forever: raw, unbridled performance. I'm happy to spend money on nice dedicated hardware because I know that <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/hardware-is-cheap-programmers-are-expensive.html\">hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut to be totally honest with you, mostly I build servers because it's fun.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> matches the best developers (you!) with the best employers.

Other than read this blog entry, I mean.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHave you ever noticed that a huge percentage of <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/\">Lifehacker</a>-like productivity porn site content is a breathless description of the details of <b>Yet Another To-Do Application</b>? There are dozens upon dozens of the things to choose from, on any platform you can name. At this point it's getting a little ridiculous; per <a href=\"http://twitter.com/howtogeek/status/240118145191395329\">Lifehacker's Law</a>, you'd need a to-do app just to keep track of all the freaking to-do apps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've tried to maintain to-do lists at various points in my life. And I've always failed. Utterly and completely. Even turning it into a game, like the cleverly constructed <a href=\"http://www.rexbox.co.uk/epicwin/\">Epic Win app</a>, didn't work for me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEventually I realized that the problem wasn't me. All my to-do lists started out as innocuous tools to assist me in my life, but slowly transformed, each and every time, into thankless, soul-draining exercises in reductionism. <b><a href=\"http://www.encouragementfromastranger.com/2011/is-your-to-do-list-killing-you/\">My to-do list was killing me</a></b>. Adam Wozniak nails it:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor the things in my life that actually <i>mattered</i>, I've never needed any to-do list to tell me to do them. If I did, then that'd be awfully strong evidence that I have some serious life problems to face before considering the rather trivial matter of which to-do lifehack fits my personality best. As for the things that didn't matter in my life, well, those just tended to pile up endlessly in the old to-do list. And <b>the collective psychic weight of all these minor undone tasks</b> were caught up in my ever-growing to-do katamari ball, where they continually weighed on me, day after day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, there's that everpresent giant to-do list, hanging right there over your head like a guillotine, growing <a href=\"http://secretgeek.net/Task_hoard.asp\">sharper and heavier every day</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut are you using the <i>right</i> guillotine? Maybe it'd work better if you tried this newer, shinier guillotine? I'd like to offer you some advice:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere's my challenge. <b>If you can't wake up every day and, using your 100% original equipment God-given organic brain, come up with the three most important things you need to do that day</b> &ndash; then you should seriously work on fixing that. I don't mean install another app, or read more productivity blogs and books. You have to figure out what's important to you and what motivates you; ask yourself why that stuff isn't gnawing at you enough to make you get it done. Fix <i>that</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Tools will come and go, but <b>your brain and your gut will be here with you for the rest of your life</b>. Learn to trust them. And if you can't, do whatever it takes to train them until you can trust them. If it matters, if it <i>really matters</i>, you'll remember to do it.

You might say he's a <i>billion</i> times better at hyperbole than the average blogger. In his own way, he is a creator, I suppose: he creates hype.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he's not entirely wrong here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've noticed the same pattern in my own computing habits. As I wrote in <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/09/the-last-pc-laptop.html\">The Last PC Laptop</a>, it's becoming more and more difficult to justify any situation where a traditional laptop is your best choice &ndash; even a modern, svelte, fancypants laptop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDesktops, on the other hand, are perfectly justifiable. That is, if you want <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html\">three monitors</a>, eight blazingly fast CPU cores, 64 GB of memory, and fire-breathing multi-GPU configurations. If you <i>need</i> absurd, obscene amounts of power, a desktop computer is the way to go. And it's probably <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/07/building-a-pc-part-vii-rebooting.html\">cheaper than you think</a>, because desktops are all built from the same interchangeable pool of parts. It's also a lot more fun than laptops, because <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/01/screwdrivers-vs-couture.html\">willingness to tinker</a> combined with lust for ostentatious power is the essence of <b>hot rodding</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd it is freakin' awesome. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut even as an inveterate PC hot-rodder, I've noticed that in the last few years <b>I've started to lose interest in the upgrade treadmill</b> of ever faster CPUs with more cores, more sophisticated GPUs, more bandwidth, more gigabytes of RAM. Other than solid state drives, which gave us a badly needed order of magnitude <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html\">improvement in disk speeds</a>, when was the last time you felt you <i>needed</i> to upgrade a powerful desktop or laptop computer? If I dropped a SSD in it, do you honestly think you could tell the difference in real world non-gaming desktop usage between a high end 2009 personal computer and one from today?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause I'm not sure I could.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImagine the despair of a hot-rodder who regularly sees the streets awash in boring Chrysler K-Cars and Plymouth minivans with more ponies under the hood than a sweet custom rig he built just two years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI think we're <i>way</i> past the point of satisfying the computing performance needs of the typical user. I'd say we hit that around the time dual CPU cores became mainstream, perhaps 2008 or so. What do you do when you have all the computing performance anyone could ever possibly need, except for the freakish one-percenters, the video editors and programmers? Once you have \"enough\" computing power, for whatever value of \"enough\" we can agree to disagree on, <b>the future of computing is, and always has been, to make the computers smaller and cheaper.</b> This is not some new trend that MG Siegler revealed unto the world from his journalistic fortress of solitude.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\nWe've already seen this before in the transition from mainframes that fit in a building, to minicomputers that fit in a room, to microcomputers that fit on your desk. Now we're ready for the next stage: computers that don't just fit in your lap, they <b>fit in your <i>hand</i></b>. The name of the game is no longer to make computers more powerful, but to radically reduce their size and power consumption without compromising the performance too much.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI mentioned how boring the performance scene has gotten for laptops and desktops. It's so boring that I can't be bothered to dig up representative benchmarks. Let's just assume that, outside of SSDs, there have been at best cost-of-living inflation type improvements in desktop and laptop benchmarks since 2008. Now contrast that with <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410034,00.asp\">the hyperbolic performance improvement in the iPhone since 2008</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn case the graph didn't make it clear, in the last four years of iPhone, we've seen a <b>factor of 20</b> improvement in Browsermark and a <b>factor of four</b> improvement in GeekBench. In the smartphone world, performance is &ndash; in the worst case &ndash; <i>almost doubling every year</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIronically enough, these results were <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410034,00.asp\">printed in PC magazine</a>. I'd like to draw your attention to two little letters in the title of said magazine. The first one is Pee, and the second one is Cee. That's right, <i>PC Magazine</i> is now in the business of printing the kind of smartphone performance benchmarks that are enough to make any hotrodder drool. What does that have to do with PCs? Well, it has everything to do with PCs, actually.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI have an iPhone 5, and I can personally attest that it is <i>crazy</i> faster than the old iPhone 4 I upgraded from. Once you add in 4G, LTE, and 5 GHz WiFi support, it's so fast that &ndash; except for the obvious size limitations of a smaller screen &ndash; I find myself not caring that much if I get the \"mobile\" version of websites any more. Even before the speed, I noticed the dramatically improved display. AnandTech says that if the iPhone 5 display was a desktop monitor, it would be <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6334/iphone-5-screen-performance\">the best one they had ever tested</a>. Our phones are now so damn fast and capable as <i>personal computers</i> that I'm starting to wonder why I don't just use the thing I always have in my pocket as my \"laptop\", plugging it into a keyboard and display as necessary.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo maybe MG Siegler is right. The PC <i>is</i> over &hellip; at least <b>in the form that we knew it</b>. We no longer need giant honking laptop and desktop form factors for computers any more than we need entire rooms and floors of a building to house mainframes and minicomputers.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] What's your next career move? <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> has the best job listings from great companies, whether you're looking for opportunities at a startup or Fortune 500.

In all likelihood, this is not a post you will enjoy reading. Consider yourselves warned.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI don't remember how I found this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdBJ1X33rXM\">Moth video of comedian Anthony Griffith</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is not a fun thing to watch, especially as a parent. Even though I knew that before I went in, I willingly chose to watch this video. Then I watched it again. And again. And again. I watched it five times, ten times. I am all for <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio\">leaning into the pain</a>, but I started to wonder if maybe I was addicted to the pain. I think my dumb programmer brain was stuck in an endless loop trying to make sense out of what happened here. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut you don't make sense of a tragedy like this. You <i>can't</i>. There are no answers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe unbearable grief demands that someone <i>must</i> be to blame for this unimaginably terrible thing that is happening to you, this deeply, profoundly unfair tragedy. But there's nobody. Just you and this overwhelming burden you've been given. So you keep going, because that's what you're supposed to do. Maybe you get on stage and talk about it. That's about all you <i>can</i> do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo that's what I'm going to do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFive weeks ago, I was selected for jury duty in a medical malpractice trial. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis trial was the story of a perfectly healthy man who, in the summer of 2008, was suddenly killed by a massive blood clot that made its way to his heart, after a surgery to repair a broken leg. Like me, he would have been 41 years old today. Like me, he married his wife in the summer of 1999. Like me, he had three children; two girls and a boy. Like me, he had a promising, lucrative career in IT. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI should have known I was in trouble during jury selection. When they called your name, you'd come up from the juror pool &ndash; about 50 people by my estimation &ndash; and sit in the jury booth while both lawyers asked you some questions to determine if you'd be a fair and impartial juror for this trial. What I hadn't noticed at the time, because she was obscured by a podium, is that the wife was sitting directly in front of the jury. I heard plenty of people get selected and make up some bogus story about how they couldn't possibly be fair and impartial to get out of this five week obligation. And they did, if they stuck to their story. But sitting there myself, in front of the wife of this dead man, I just couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to lie when I saw on her face that her desire not to be there was a million times more urgent than mine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow, I'm all for civic duty, but five weeks in a jury seemed like a bit more than my fair share. Even worse, I was an alternate juror, which meant all of the responsibility of showing up every day and listening, but none of the actual responsibility of contributing to the eventual verdict. I was expecting crushing boredom, and there was certainly plenty of that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn day one, during opening remarks, we were treated to multiple, giant projected photographs of the three happy children with their dead father &ndash; directly in front of the very much still alive wife. She had to leave the courtroom at one point. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe first person we heard testimony from was this man's father, who was and is a practicing doctor. He was there when his son was rushed to the emergency room. He was allowed to observe as the emergency room personnel worked, so he described to the jury the medical process of treatment, his son thrashing around on the emergency room table being intubated, his heart stopping and being revived. As a doctor, he knows what this means. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn day two, we heard from the brother-in-law, also a doctor, and close friend of the family. He described coming home from the hospital to explain to the children that their father was dead, that he wasn't coming home. The kids were not old enough to understand what death means, so for a year afterward, every time they drove by the hospital, they would ask to visit their dad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI did not expect to learn what death truly was in a courtroom in Martinez, California, at age 41. But I did. Death is a room full of strangers listening to your loved ones describe, in clinical detail and with tears in their eyes, your last moments. Boredom, I can deal with. This is something else entirely.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs a juror, you're ordered not to discuss the trial with anyone, so that you can form a fair and impartial opinion based on the shared evidence that everyone saw in the courtroom together. So I'm taking all this in and I'm holding it down, like I'm supposed to. But it's hard. I feel like becoming a parent has <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/on-parenthood.html\">opened emotional doors in me that I didn't know existed</a>, so it's getting to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSometime later, the wife finally testifies. She explains that on the night of the incident, her husband finally felt well enough after the surgery on his right leg to read a bedtime story to their 4 year old son. So she happily leaves father and son to have their bedtime ritual together. Later, the son comes rushing in and tells her there's something wrong with dad, and the look on his face is enough to let her know that it's dire. She found him collapsed on the floor of her son's room and calls 911.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA week later, I was putting our 4 year old son Henry to bed. I didn't realize it at the time, but this was the first time I had put him to bed since the trial started. Henry isn't quite old enough to have a stable sleep routine, so sometimes bedtime goes well, and sometimes it doesn't. It went well that particular night, so I'm happy lying there with him in the bed waiting for his breathing to become regular so I know he's fully asleep. And then the next thing I know I'm breaking down. Badly. I'm desperately trying to hold it together because I don't want to scare him, and he doesn't need to know about any of this. But I can't stop thinking about what it would feel like for my wife to see pictures of me with our children if I died. I can't stop thinking about what it would feel like to watch Henry die on an emergency room table at age 38. I can't stop thinking about what it would feel like to explain to someone else's children that their father is never coming home again. Most of all, I can't stop thinking about the other 4 year old boy who will never stop blaming himself because he saw his Dad collapse on the floor of his room, and then never saw him again for the rest of his life.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSomebody is to blame for this. <i>Somebody must be to blame for this.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow I urgently want this trial to be over. I'm struggling to understand the purpose of it all. Nothing we see or do in this courtroom is bringing a husband and father back from the dead. The plaintiff could be home with her children. The parade of doctors and hospital staff making their way through this courtroom could be helping patients. The jurors could be working at their jobs. My God how I would love to be doing my job rather than this, anything in the world other than this. A verdict for either party has immense cost. Nobody is in this courtroom because they want to be here. So <i>why?</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI don't know these people. I don't care about these people. I mean, it's in my job description as a juror: I am fair and impartial <i>because</i> I don't care what happens to them. But finally I realized that this trial is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0\">part of our ride</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe get on the ride because we know there will be thrills and chills. Nobody gets on a rollercoaster that goes in a straight line. That's what you sign up for when you get on the ride with the rest of us: there will be highs, and there will be lows. And those lows &ndash; whether they are, God forbid, your own, or someone else's &ndash;  are what make the highs so sweet. The ride is what it is because the pain of those valleys teaches us.\r\n</p>\r\nSharing this tragic, horrible, private thing that happened to these poor people is how we cope. Watching this play out in public, among your peers, among other fellow human beings, is what it takes to for all of us to survive and move on. We're here in this courtroom together because we <i>need</i> to be here. It's part of the ride.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI've heard and seen things in that courtroom I think I will remember for the rest of my life. It's been difficult to deal with, though I am sure it is the tiniest reflected fraction of what you and your family went through. I am so, so sorry this happened to you. But I want to thank you for sharing it with me, because I now know that I am to blame. We're all to blame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat's what makes us human.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] Hiring developers?

I quickly gravitated to so-called ultraportable laptops as soon as they became available. The first one was the 2003 <a href=\"http://compreviews.about.com/cs/laptops/gr/aaprDellIns300m.htm\">Dell Inspiron 300M</a>. It was the first laptop I found that delivered a decent 3-ish pound package without too many compromises. How I loved this little thing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut there was a downside to that 2003-era ultraportability &ndash; the default battery in the system provided about 2 hours of runtime. Switching to the larger battery extended that to a much more respectable 5.5 hours, but it also added a pound to the system and protruded from the rear a bit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've pursued the same dream of <b>reasonable power with extreme portability</b> ever since, with varying degrees of success. The PC industry <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/01/there-are-no-design-leaders-in-the-pc-world.html\">isn't exactly known for its design leadership</a>, and it can be downright schizophrenic at times. So if you were a fan of laptops that were actually thin and light and <i>portable</i>, it's been rough going for a long time. 2007's <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/dell-xps-m1330-review.html\">Dell XPS M1330</a> was a brief bright spot, but honestly, it's only in the last few months I've found an ultraportable that lived up to my expectations, one that I feel confident in recommending. That laptop is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00863L2PK/?tag=codihorr-20\">Asus Zenbook Prime UX31A</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving lived with this laptop for about two months now, I can safely say it is without question <b>the best PC laptop I've ever owned</b>. Consider the <a href=\"http://techreport.com/review/23584/asus-zenbook-prime-ux31a\">Tech Report review</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/12/asus-zenbook-prime-ux31a-ultrabook-review/\">Engadget review</a>, both rave. Here's what you need to know:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Retina-esque 1920x1080 resolution in an amazingly high quality 13.3\" IPS display</li>\r\n<li>Intel's latest 17 watt Ivy Bridge processor with (finally!) decent integrated graphics</li>\r\n<li>128 GB SSD with fast 6Gbps interface</li>\r\n<li>Just under 3 pounds</li>\r\n<li>Decent 6 hour runtime</li>\r\n<li>Classy brushed metal case and cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nAll of this for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00863L2PK/?tag=codihorr-20\">about $1,050</a> at the time of writing. If you're suffering through a sub-par TN display on your current laptop, the awesome IPS display is almost worth an upgrade on its own. After switching to <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html\">bargain Korean IPS displays</a> on the desktop, I'm desperately hoping my poor eyeballs never have to endure another awful TN LCD display for the rest of my life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a machine that pleasantly surprised me at every turn. The keyboard is solid feeling with a dimmable backlight, and the achilles heel of all PC laptops, the trackpad, is about as good as it ever gets on PCs. Which is to say still not great. Even the power adapter is classy, although highly derivative of Apple. While this is substantially closer to the ideal ultraportable hardware I've had in my brain since 2003, it still exhibits some of the same problems I experienced with that Inspiron 300M almost 10 years ago:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An operating system pre-loaded with <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/stop-having-trouble.html\">useless craplets and pointless bloatware</a>, all in the name of hypothetical value add by the vendor and/or marketing subsidies.\r\n<li>Several branding stickers I had to peel off the machine after I opened the box. (Note that the press photos for a machine <i>never</i> include these ugly stickers. Go figure.)\r\n<li>A trackpad that works kinda-sorta OK, but never quite inspires enough confidence that I can stop carrying an external mouse around in my laptop bag with me.\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nThe first thing I did when I got the laptop was <b>wipe it and install the Windows 8 preview</b>, and soon after updated it to the final Windows 8 release. Despite all the grousing about the tablet-centric nature of Windows 8 &ndash; some of which is warranted, but can <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Windows8ProductivityWhoMovedMyCheeseOhThereItIs.aspx\">easily be ignored entirely</a> &ndash; I am an unabashed fan of the operating system. It is a big improvement over Windows 7 in my day to day use. The more I use Windows 8 the more I believe it's the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/betting-the-company-on-windows-8.html\">biggest step forward in Windows</a> since Windows 95. So what I've put together here is probably the best, most platonic ideal form of Wintel laptop hardware you can buy in mid-2012.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n(In the interests of full disclosure, I actually own two of these. One for my wife and one for me. Because I am an inveterate hotrodder, I had to have more memory and a larger, faster SSD. So I bought the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00863L2MS/?tag=codihorr-20\">UX32VD model</a> which has a discrete Nvidia 620M GPU and, most importantly, <i>can</i> be upgraded internally. So I dropped in a Samsung 830 512 GB SSD and 8 GB DIMM. This led to a slightly oddball final configuration of 10 GB RAM and an internal embedded 32 GB SSD plus the 512 GB SSD. It hurts battery life by at least an hour, too. You should also know that the teeny-tiny Torx screws on the back of this laptop are not to be trifled with. Bring your jeweler's loupe. In case it wasn't already abundantly clear, let me spell it out for you: going this route is not recommended unless you are as crazy as I am. The base model is really nice! Trust me!)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf pressed, I might admit the combination of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00863L2PK/?tag=codihorr-20\">ASUS Zenbook Prime</a> hardware and modern Windows 8 amenities lives up to the whole Intel \"Ultrabook\" marketing schtick. But I'm not sure that's enough any more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEvery time I leave the house &ndash; heck, every time I leave the <i>room</i> &ndash; I have to decide what kind of computer I'm going to take with me, if any. Besides the ultraportable laptops, I now own an iPhone 5, several retina iPads, and a Nexus 7. I'm sure there are many more of these devices on the way. In the calculus of deciding what kind of computing device I want with me, even the most awesome ultraportable laptop I can find is no longer enough. Consider:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Want 10 hours of real world battery life?</b> Even when doing actual work that would ramp the CPU up? Many tablets and phones can achieve that magical 10 hour battery life figure, but it will be <a href=\"http://blog.lenovo.com/products/when-will-batteries-last-the-work-week\">a long, <i>long</i> time before you reliably get that out of any ultraportable laptop</a>. Personally, I blame x86.<br><br></li>\r\n<li><b>Want to start doing stuff immediately?</b> Even Windows 8, which has radically improved wake times, is laughably slow to start up compared to tablets and phones which are practically instant-on by design.<br><br></li>\r\n<li><b>Want the smallest most portable device you can get away with?</b> It's unlikely that will be a laptop, even an ultraportable, because of the implied keyboard and connectivity ports, plus the big screen and hinge. There is no form factor more compact than the touchscreen tablet. And you've got to take your phone along in any case, because that's how your family and loved ones will contact you, right? Have you <i>seen</i> the iPhone 5 benchmarks? It's faster than most tablets!<br><br></li>\r\n<li><b>Want to be always connected to the Internet?</b> Sure you do; how else can you get to Stack Overflow and <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com\">Stack Exchange</a> for all of life's essential questions? Then you probably need some kind of cellular support, for 3G or 4G or LTE or whatever the telephone companies are calling high speed Internet access these days. That is quite rare on traditional laptops, but obviously common on phones and much easier to find on tablets.<br><br></li>\r\n<li><b>Want easy access?</b> Just <i>try</i> opening a laptop on a crowded subway train or bus. Or with, say, 3 toddlers running around your house. I dare you. But phones and 7\" tablets offer easy one handed operation; you can whip them out and fill whatever time you have available, whereas cracking open a laptop feels like a sizable commitment in time and space to doing something.\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nMy laptop is increasingly a device I only take when I know I'll need to do a lot of typing, and/or I'll need a lot of screen space to work. But even a phone could do that if it had decent support for bluetooth keyboards and external displays, couldn't it? And even a few programmers, the audience who would most need all the power and flexibility of laptops, are <a href=\"http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad\">switching to tablets</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI've waited 12 years for the PC industry to get its collective act together and, if nothing else, successfully copy Apple's laptop hardware designs. Now that they (mostly) have, I wonder: is it too late? Has the PC industry irrevocably shifted underneath them while they were so busy pumping out endless refinements to generic x86 boxes? I love this new laptop, and in many ways it is the perfect ultraportable hardware I dreamed of having in 2003. But every time I power it up and use it, I feel a little sad. I can't shake the feeling that this might end up being <b>the last PC laptop I ever own</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> matches the best developers (you!) with the best employers.

But was it <i>crime?</i> Was I truly a <i>criminal?</i> I don't think so. To be perfectly blunt, I wasn't talented enough to be any kind of threat. I'm still not.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two classic books describing hackers active in the 1980s who <i>did</i> have incredible talent. Talents that made them dangerous enough to be considered criminal threats.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416507787/?tag=codihorr-20\">The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316037702/?tag=codihorr-20\">Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCuckoo is arguably the first case of hacking that was a clearly malicious crime circa 1986, and certainly the first known case of computer hacking as international espionage. I read this when it was originally published in 1989, and it's still a gripping investigative story. Cliff Stoll is a visionary writer who saw <b>how trust in computers and the emerging Internet could be vulnerable to real, actual, honest-to-God <i>criminals</i>.</b> \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI'm not sure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick\">Kevin Mitnick</a> did anything all that illegal, but there's no denying that he was the world's first high profile computer criminal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1994 he made the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, and there were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/04/us/cyberspace-s-most-wanted-hacker-eludes-fbi-pursuit.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm\">front page New York Times articles about his pursuit</a>. If there was ever a moment that computer crime and \"hacking\" entered the public consciousness as an ongoing concern, this was it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The whole story is told in minute detail by Kevin himself in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316037702/?tag=codihorr-20\">Ghost in the Wires</a>. There was a sanitized version of Kevin's story presented in <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/our-hacker-odyssey.html\">Wizzywig comix</a> but this is the original directly from the source, and it's well worth reading. I could barely put it down. Kevin has been fully reformed for many years now; he wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Kevin%20Mitnick&ie=UTF8&search-alias=books&sort=relevancerank\">several books</a> documenting his techniques and now <a href=\"http://mitnicksecurity.com/\">consults</a> with companies to help improve their computer security. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese two books cover the genesis of all computer crime as we know it. Of course it's a much bigger problem now than it was in 1985, if for no other reason than there are far more computers far more interconnected with each other today than anyone could have possibly imagined in those early days. But what's really surprising is <b>how little has changed in the techniques of computer crime since 1985</b>.\r\n</p>\r\nThe best primer of modern &ndash; and by that I mean year 2000 and later &ndash; computer crime is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307588688/?tag=codihorr-20\">Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground</a>. Modern computer crime is more like the classic sort of crime you've seen in black and white movies: it's mostly about stealing large sums of money. But instead of busting it out of bank vaults Bonnie and Clyde style, it's now done electronically, mostly through ATM and credit card exploits.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWritten by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Poulsen\">Kevin Poulson</a>, another famous reformed hacker, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307588688/?tag=codihorr-20\">Kingpin</a> is also a compelling read. I've read it twice now. The passage I found most revealing is this one, written after the protagonist's release from prison in 2002:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll true; no hacker today would bother with frontal assaults. The chance of success is miniscule. Instead, they target the soft, creamy underbelly of all companies: the users inside. Max, the hacker described in Kingpin, bragged \"I've been confident of my 100 percent [success] rate ever since.\" This is the new face of hacking. Or is it?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the most striking things about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316037702/?tag=codihorr-20\">Ghost In The Wires</a> is not how skilled a computer hacker Kevin Mitnick is (although he is undeniably great), but how devastatingly effective he is at <b>tricking people into revealing critical information in casual conversations</b>. Over and over again, in hundreds of subtle and clever ways. Whether it's 1985 or 2005, the amount of military-grade security you have on your computer systems matters not at all when someone using those computers <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/the-dancing-bunnies-problem.html\">clicks on the dancing bunny</a>. Social engineering is <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/05/phishing-the-forever-hack.html\">the most reliable and evergreen hacking technique ever devised</a>. It will outlive us all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a 2012 era example, consider <a href=\"http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard\">the story of Mat Honan</a>. It is not unique.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI heard about this on Twitter when the story was originally developing, and my initial reaction was skepticism that anyone had bothered to brute force anything at all, since <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/brute-force-key-attacks-are-for-dummies.html\">brute forcing is for dummies</a>. Guess what it turned out to be. Go ahead, guess!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDid you by any chance guess <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\">social engineering &hellip; of the account recovery process</a>? Bingo.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPhobia, the hacker Mat Honan documents, was a minor who did this for laughs. One of his friends is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/09/cosmo-the-god-who-fell-to-earth/all/\">a 15 year old hacker who goes by the name of Cosmo</a>; he's the one who discovered the Amazon credit card technique described above. And what are teenage hackers up to these days?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe techniques are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/09/cosmo-the-god-who-fell-to-earth/all/\">eerily similar</a>. The only difference between Cosmo and Kevin Mitnick is that they were born in different decades. Computer crime is a whole new world now, but the techniques used today are almost identical to those used in the 1980s.

Mom told me to come home immediately because, well, there were police at the front door asking for me with some legal papers in hand. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLike I said, definitely not a good day. The only sliver of good news was that I was still 17 at the time, so I enjoyed the many protections that the law provides to a minor. Which I shall now throw away by informing the world that I am a dirty, filthy, reprehensible adult criminal. <i>Thanks, law!</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the problems you had in the pre-Internet 1980s as a hardcore computer geek was that <b>all the best bulletin boards and online services were kind of expensive</b>. Either because you had to pay an hourly fee to access them, like <a href=\"v\">CompuServe</a>, or because they were a long distance modem call. Or both. Even after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System_divestiture#Effects\">the 1984 AT&T breakup</a>, long distance at <a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/211826/Long-Distance-Rates-For-the-Late-Seventies-and-Early-Eighties\">around 20-30 cents a minute</a> was a far, far cry from today's rates. (Does anyone actually even worry about how much voice calls cost any more, to anywhere in the world? This, my friends, is progress.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRemember, too, that this is back when 9600 baud modems were <i>blazing</i>, state of the art devices. For perspective, the ultra-low-power wireless bluetooth on your phone is about 80 times faster. If you wanted to upload or download any <s>warez</s> software, that meant potentially <b>hours on your modem at rates of around $20/hour.</b> Adjusted for inflation, that's closer to $40 in 2012 dollars. My family wasn't well off enough to afford a second telephone line, so most of my calling was done late at night both because the rates were lower, and also so that I wouldn't be monopolizing the telephone. Nothing was worse than the dreaded \"mom picked up the phone\" disconnect to an <s>elite</s> difficult-to-access BBS with limited slots.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne way or another, I eventually got involved with the seedier side of the community, even joining a lesser Apple // pirate group. Probably my main claim to fame is that while <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/11/preserving-our-digital-pre-history.html\">trolling BBSes</a>, I personally discovered and recruited a guy who turned out to be an amazing cracker. He was so good he eventually got recruited away. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was, at best, a footnote to a footnote to a footnote in Apple // history. This was mainly a process of self-discovery for me. I learned I was the type of geek who doesn't even bother attending his high school prom, partially because I was still afraid of girls even as a high school senior, yes, but mainly because I was so addicted to computers and playing my tiny role in these nascent online communities. I was, and am, OK with that. This is the circuitous path of 30 years that led me to create Stack Overflow. And there's more, so much more, but I can't talk about it yet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut addicted, I think, is too weak a word for what I felt about being a part of these oddball, early online home computer communities. It was more like an all-consuming maniacal blood lust. So <b>obtaining access to free, unlimited long distance calling</b> rapidly became an urgent priority in my teenage life. I needed it. I needed it so bad. I had to have it to talk on the phone to the other members of my motley little crew, who were spread all over the USA, as well as for calling BBSes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI can't remember exactly how I found it, probably on one of the BBSes, but I eventually discovered a local 804 area code number for \"calling cards\" that accepted a 5 digit PIN, entered via touch-tone phone. Try over and over, and you might find some valid PIN codes that let you attain the holy grail of free long distance calling. Only one small problem: it's a crime. But, at least to my addled teenage brain, this was a victimless crime, one that I <i>had</i> to commit. The spice must flow!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll I had to do is write software to tell the modem to dial over and over and try different combinations. Because I was a <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/a-scripter-at-heart.html\">self-taught programmer</a>, this was no problem. But because I was an <i>overachieving</i> self-taught programmer, I didn't just write a program. No, I went off and built <b>a full-blown toolkit in AppleBasic</b>, with complete documentation and the best possible text user interface I could muster, and then uploaded it to my favorite BBSes so every other addict could get their online modem fix, too. I called it <b>The Hacking Construction Set</b>, and I spent <i>months</i> building it. I didn't just <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/12/gold-plating.html\">gold plate</a>, I <i>platinum</i> plated this freaking thing, man. (Yes, I know the name isn't really correct. <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/our-hacker-odyssey.html\">I read as many 2600 textfiles as the next guy</a>. This is mere phreaking, not hacking, but I guess I was shooting for poetic license. Maybe you could use the long distance dialing codes to actually hack remote machines, or something.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI never knew if anyone else ever used my little program to dial for calling codes. It certainly worked for me, and I tried my level best to make it work for all the possible dialing situations I could think of. It even had an intro screen with music and graphics of my own creation. But searching now, for the first time in 24 years, I <a href=\"http://nitroroms.com/show/file-info/L28583/Apple_II/Hacking%20Construction%20Set%20IIe%20(19xx)(Cyborg).zip.html\">found my old Hacking Construction Set disk image on an Apple ROM site</a>. It even has real saved numbers in the dialing list! Someone <i>was</i> using my illicit software!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you're curious, fire up your favorite Apple // emulator and give <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/files/hacking-construction-set-apple-ii-disk-image.dsk\">the disk image</a> a spin. Don't forget to connect your modem. There's full blown documentation accessible from the main menu. Which, re-reading now, was actually not half bad, if I do say so myself:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI used to regularly call BBSes in Florida, California, and Missouri? That's news to me; I haven't seen any of this stuff in over 24 years! All I did was upload a disk image to a few BBSes in 1986. After all that time, to discover that someone used and loved my little bit of software still gives me a little thrill. What higher praise is there for a software developer? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout that trouble. <b>Using my own software got me in trouble with the law.</b> And deservedly so; what I wrote the software to do was illegal. I hired a local lawyer (who, as I recall, was missing a hand; he had a prosthetic hand that was almost impossible not to look at) who represented me. It was quite clear at preliminary hearings that the Chesterfield County court system did not see any computer crime cases, and they had absolutely no idea what to make of me, or what this was all about. All they saw was a smart kid with a bit of bad judgment who loved computers and was headed to the University of Virginia, most likely not a life as a career criminal. So the case was dismissed for the cost of lawyer's fees. Which, for the record, I had to pay myself, using my income as a Safeway cashier.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was definitely a wake up call for me; in the summer of 1988, I was about to graduate from high school, and I thought I'd try being just a regular guy at college, with less of an obsessive focus on computers that causes me to get in trouble with the law, and perhaps spread my wings to other interests. Who knows, maybe even <i>girls!</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat didn't last long. Because after all these years, I must confess I've grown to love my own bad judgment. It's led me to the most fascinating places.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> matches the best developers (you!) with the best employers.

The other 20% of the time, you can work on <i>whatever you like</i> &ndash; provided it advances Google in some way. At least, that's the theory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGoogle's 20 percent time policy is well known in software engineering circles by now. What's <i>not</i> as well known is that this concept <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663137/how-3m-gave-everyone-days-off-and-created-an-innovation-dynamo\">dates all the way back to 1948 at 3M</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere's not much documentation on HP's version of this; when I do find mentions of it, it's always referred to as a \"convention\", not an explicit policy. Robert X. Cringely <a href=\"http://www.cringely.com/2011/08/19/losing-the-hp-way/\">provides more detail</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMaybe HP did invent this, since they've been around since 1939. Dave Raggett, for example, apparently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett\">played a major role in inventing HTML</a> on his 10% time at HP.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough the concept predates Google, they've done more to validate it as an actual strategy and popularize it in tech circles than anyone else. Oddly enough, I can't <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awww.google.com+%2220-percent+time%22\">find</a> any mention of the 20% time benefit listed on the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/\">current Google jobs page</a>, but it's an integral part of Google's culture. And for good reason: notable 20 percent projects include <a href=\"http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html\">GMail</a>, Google News, Google Talk, and AdSense. According to ex-employee Marissa Meyer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Innovation_Time_Off\">as many as half</a> of Google's products originated from that 20% time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt Hewlett-Packard, 3M, and Google, \"many\" of their best and most popular products come from <b>the thin sliver of time they granted employees to work on <i>whatever they wanted to.</i></b> What does this mean? Should we all be goofing off more at work and experimenting with our own ideas? That's what the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062003232/codihorr-20\">The 20% Doctrine</a> explores.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClosely related to 20% time is the <b>Hack Day</b>. Hack Days carve out a specific 24 hour timeframe from the schedule, encouraging large groups to come together to work collaboratively (or in friendly competition) during that period. Chad Dickerson <a href=\"http://blog.chaddickerson.com/2012/04/18/the-20-percent-doctrine/\">instituted one of the first</a> at Yahoo in 2005.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtlassian's version, a <a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/shipit-day\">quarterly ShipIt Day</a>, also dates back to 2005. Interestingly, they also attempted to emulate Google's 20% time policy with <a href=\"http://blogs.atlassian.com/2009/02/atlassians_20_time_a_year_in_review/\">mixed results</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think there's enough of a track record of documented success that <b>it's worth lobbying for something like Hack Days or 20% time wherever you work</b>. But before you do, consider if you and your company are ready:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving some official acknowledgement that time spent working on whatever <i>you</i> think will make things better around these here parts is not just tolerated &ndash; but encouraged &ndash; might go a long way towards <b>making work feel a lot less like <i>work</i></b>.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] What's your next career move? <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> has the best job listings from great companies, whether you're looking for opportunities at a startup or Fortune 500.

And on my laptop. And everywhere else in my life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI'll spare you all the exposition and jump to the punchline. I am now the proud owner of three awesome high resolution (2560x1440) 27\" IPS LCDs, and <b>I paid less than a thousand dollars for all three of them</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n(If you're curious about the setup, I use <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/lcd-monitor-arms.html\">Ergotron monitor arms</a> to fit everything in there.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI won't deny that it is a little weird, because everything is in Korean. I replaced the Korean 3 prong power cord in the power brick with a regular US power cord I had laying around. But a monitor is a monitor, and <i>the IPS panel is stunning</i>. <b>The difference between TN and IPS is vast in every measurable dimension.</b> No bad pixels on these three panels, either. Although, as my friend Scott Wasson of <a href=\"http://techreport.com\">Tech Report</a> fame says, \"every pixel on a TN panel is a bad pixel\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow is this possible? You can thank Korea. All three of these monitors were ordered from Korean eBay vendors, where a great 27\" IPS LCD goes for the equivalent of around $250 in local currency. They tack on $100 for profit and shipping to the USA, then they're in business. It's definitely a grey market, but something is clearly out of whack, because no domestic monitor of similar quality and size can be had for anything under $700.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI wanted to get this out there, because I'm not sure how long this grey market will last, and these monitors are truly incredible deals. Heck, <b>it's worth it just to get out of the awful TN display ghetto most of us are stuck in</b>. Scott Wasson got the <i>exact</i> same model of Korean LCD I did, and <a href=\"http://techreport.com/articles.x/23291\">his thorough review</a> concludes:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are literally dozens of variants of these Korean 27\" LCDs, but the model I got is the <b>FSM-270YG</b>. Before you go rushing off to type ebay.com in your browser address bar, remember that these are bare-bones monitors being shipped from Korea. They work great, don't get me wrong, but they are the definition of no-frills:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Build quality is acceptable, but it's hardly Jony Ive Approved&trade;.\r\n<li>These are glossy panels. Some other variants offer matte, if that's your bag.\r\n<li>They only support basic dual-link DVI inputs, and <i>nothing</i>, I mean <i>nothing</i> else. \r\n<li>There is no on-screen display. The only functional controls are power and brightness (this one caught me out; you must hold down the brightness adjustment for many, many seconds before you see a change.)\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough the noise-to-signal ratio is off the charts, it might be worth visiting <a href=\"http://www.overclock.net/t/1215866/reviewed-400-2560x1440-ips-no-ag-90hz-achieva-shimian-qh270-and-catleap-q270\">the original overclock.net thread</a> on these inexpensive Korean monitors. There's some great info buried in there, if you can manage to extract it from the chaos. And if you're looking for a teardown of this particular FSM-270YG model (minus the OSD, though), check out <a href=\"http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/content/dgm_ips-2701wph.htm\">the TFT Central review</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the past, I favored my wallet over my eyes, and chose TN. I now deeply regret that decision. But the tide is turning, and <b>high quality IPS displays are no longer extortionately expensive, particularly if you buy them directly from Korea</b>. Is it a little risky? Sure, but all signs point to the risk being fairly low.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the end, I decided my eyes deserve better than TN. Maybe yours do too.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n[advertisement] Hiring developers?
